        [p class="end"]Welcome aboard![/p]
        [p]The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.[/p]
        [p]You've just come aboard the space station [em]Nebula[/em], home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a [em]Nebula[/em] operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.[/p]
        [p]The [em]Nebula[/em]'s teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the [em]Challenger[/em]. If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the [em]Nebula[/em] for reinforcements.[/p]
        [p]Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on [em]your[/em] choices. Successful [em]Nebula[/em] operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.[/p]
        [p]Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you![/p]

    <text>
        [p]Captain Polaris has summoned you - and when Polaris calls, you run. You're a bit out of breath when you reach the busy Teleportation Room of the artificial moon called the [em]Nebula[/em]. Judging by your clammy palms, you're a little nervous, too. After all, you're still a new recruit.[/p]
        [p]Polaris greets you with a smile. ``I have a rather unusual assignment for you,'' he says. ``It'll probably be more fun than training camp down on Centaurus A. But,'' he adds, ``it may be a little more dangerous, too.''[/p]
        [p]``2-Tor and I are ready for some excitement,'' you reply. ``What's the job?''[/p]
        [p]``Have you ever visited the Amusement Planet?'' he asks.[/p]
        [p]``No. My parents always talked about going there, but we never got around to it''[/p]
        [p]Captain Polaris turns to 2-Tor. ``What do you know about it?'' he asks.[/p]
        [p]``It's a medium-sized planet'' 2-Tor clicks and buzzes. ``It's had its amusement function for about eighty years. Main attraction: The Cosmic Funhouse. It's all run by the Kron from the Algol system.''[/p]
        [p]``Where's that?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``Perseus. Triple star,'' he replies. ``The Amusement Planet seems to have had its heyday about forty years ago. It's a bit run-down now. That's all the information I have.''[/p]
    </text>
    <next id="3"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="3">
    <text>
        [p]``That's all you need,'' says Polaris, ``except for one thing. We've had some disturbing reports about The Cosmic Funhouse. Odd things: Whole crews disappear and nobody's sure where they are. Or they come back changed in subtle ways. Something funny is happening there, and I want you to take a look. Find out what's going on. If it's a danger to the Network of Worlds, put an end to it.''[/p]
        [p]You and 2-Tor climb aboard the [em]Challenger[/em]. You set the shuttle's controls for the Amusement Planet.[/p]
        [p]``Boy, it really is an unusual assignment,'' you whistle. ``I wonder if we should try to sneak in there without being seen.''[/p]
        [p]``Or,'' suggests 2-Tor, ``we could dress up as tourists and snoop around.''[/p]
        [p]The [em]Challenger[/em] blasts off.[/p]

        [p]As the [em]Challenger[/em] orbits the Amusement Planet, you prepare to warp down. ``We'll arrive in a big warehouse,'' 2-Tor says. ``Mice and quiet.''[/p]
        [p]Unfortunately his information is a bit out of date. The warehouse is no longer there. You materialize in the middle of a huge crowd. Luckily, no one notices you.[/p]
        [p]The Amusement Planet looks pretty much the way carnivals have looked for hundreds of years: harsh lights, all kinds of junk to eat, scary rides, loud noises.[/p]
        [p]After a minute's walking around, 2-Tor edges close. ``Don't look now, Boss,'' he says. ``I have a strong sense we're being followed.'' You sneak a look behind you, but all you see is a pile of garbage.[/p]
        [p]Then the ``garbage'' grabs you in an iron embrace. ``Mungoids!'' says 2-Tor. ``Galactic thugs!''[/p]

        [p]The beasts are too close. You hold your nose, close your eyes, and jump.[/p]
        [p]Luckily you hit the water right and don't break your back. When you bob to the surface, a boat rows to you. It contains two Brakhen from the funhouse. ``Congratulations,'' says the first. ``You've passed the test.''[/p]

        [p]You and 2-Tor decide to be tourists. You leave the [em]Challenger [/em]in the orbit sector for tourist vehicles, and warp down to the planet.[/p]
        [p]``Well, Tor,'' you joke, ``bring your microcam? You should send some pictures home to the folks.''[/p]
        [p]``What folks are those?'' asks 2-Tor, who wasn't programmed with much of a sense of humor.[/p]
        [p]The two of you walk around, observing carefully while trying to look nonchalant. What you see looks pretty harmless. Rides, games of chance, cerebrographology booths, the usual. But you sense an undercurrent here that you don't like. Something evil.[/p]
        [p]Humans have the low-level jobs of attending the attractions. But the bosses are aliens. Kron and some of the plantlike Brakhen from the Megellanic Clouds.[/p]
        [p]``May I make a suggestion, Boss?'' asks Tor. ``We might want to send for a xenologist''[/p]
        [p]``A xe-what?'' you repeat.[/p]
        [p]``An expert in alien life forms. One might come in very handy, to let us know what they're doing, and why.''[/p]
        [p]``Sounds good,'' you say, ``but if there's trouble, this xenologist might get in the way, or even hurt.''[/p]

        [p]You have 2-Tor send a request to the [em]Nebula[/em], and very shortly your xenologist beams in.[/p]
        [p]Her name is Dr. Caxton. She talks a lot about observation and alienography.[/p]
        [p]``Shall we have a look at the funhouse?'' suggests 2-Tor. You both agree.[/p]
        [p]You buy your tickets for the funhouse, wondering what to expect. As you walk in, the real world falls away. The funhouse is a world of illusion, of fantasy. Everything around you changes from moment to moment. You're in a desert, an ocean, the far reaches of drifting space. Your companions change constantly, too. You fight to remember where you are and who you're with.[/p]
        [p]You [em]do [/em]remember your mission, though, and it makes you nervous. ``Let's get going,'' you say. ``Poke around a little. Stir things up.''[/p]
        [p]Dr. Caxton disagrees. ``I think that would be unwise,'' she says. ``We should have a period of observation. We need more data on the Brakhen and their methods.''[/p]

        [p]You don't stand a chance against the Mungoid. Besides, this may be a good way to find out what's going on. ``We give up,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]The alien drags you to a large building. It has huge sealed portals made of protanium.[/p]
        [p]``This isn't one of the regular attractions, is it?'' you ask, shuddering.[/p]
        [p]``Shuddup,'' the Mungoid replies, pushing buttons on a console beside the door. The door opens with a roar.[/p]
        [p]What you find inside is staggering. It's a room the size of a hangar, with thousands of small glass booths in it.[/p]
        [p]``2-Tor, what is this?'' you gasp.[/p]
        [p]``An extremely advanced teleporter facility,'' he says. As your eyes get used to the light, you see humans and aliens in various stages of teleportation. Some of them are already half-invisible, on their way to unknown destinations. None of the travelers looks as if they want to go.[/p]
        [p]``Do you think you could break into the computer system and shut this thing down, Tor?'' you whisper.[/p]
        [p]``Possibly,'' he says. ``But shouldn't we try to find out its purpose first?''[/p]
        [p]The Mungoid shoves you toward one of the booths.[/p]

        [p]You wrench free from the Mungoid and start running. You flash past ride after ride, face after face. Hands grab at you as you run.[/p]
        [p]In desperation, you get an idea. The rides! You can use one to escape.[/p]
        [p]The Rocket Ride has just loaded up, and it's already moving. You climb on. It cannonballs into the air, gathering speed.[/p]
        [p]When the rocket reaches its highest point, you hit the propulsion system in your suit. Whee-oo! You're flying! You soar high above the lights and crowds, leaving them far behind.[/p]
        [p]At last you land. All around you are barren cliffs and crags. You haven't looked behind you once.[/p]
        [p]``Well, 2-Tor, I guess we lost him,'' you pant. ``There's nobody here.'' Silence. ``Tor?'' He's not with you![/p]
        [p]It's suicide to go back and get him. But you can't just leave him with that many Mungoid.[/p]

        [p]The two of you poke around, trying to look like any other innocent tourists. You even play a couple of games of boltbalk. You lose.[/p]
        [p]Just ahead of you is an immense building. Mammoth arches beckon you into it. The sign above the arches says THE COSMIC FUNHOUSE.[/p]
        [p]Just past the funhouse is a dark-looking tent. Its faded sign says SIDESHOW: THE HALL OF HORRORS.[/p]

        [p]Maybe 2-Tor is right. You shouldn't come in and start busting things up right away.[/p]
        [p]The Mungoid drags you and 2-Tor to the center of the room, where two booths stand empty.[/p]
        [p]You turn to the Mungoid with your most charming smile. ``Excuse me,'' you begin, ``but perhaps we could talk about th-'' The alien slams you into the side of the booth, then effortlessly picks you up and throws you inside. 2-Tor is thrown in beside you. Then the vacuum lock seals the door.[/p]
        [p]Every cell in your body is tingling with energy. But the world is fading fast around you. In the instant before you dematerialize, you pray that you and Tor will end up in the same place.[/p]
        [p]In the blink of an eye you've reached your destination. You look around warily. 2-Tor hovers beside you, thank the Galaxy.[/p]
        [p]``Great idea!'' you say. ``That's the last chrome/dome time I take your advice!''[/p]
        [p]``Wait,'' he whispers, ignoring your insults. ``I'm picking up some seismic activity.''[/p]
        [p]You feel a deep, frightening rumble. It shakes the ground beneath your feet. It grows more violent until a crevasse opens up in front of you. Finally the earth stops shaking. But you don't.[/p]
        [p]``I have a fix on our location now,'' says 2-Tor. ``We're in Sector F8-347. This planet is a young one. It's going through constant and rapid geologic change.''[/p]

        [p]``You got it, Boss,'' he replies.[/p]
        [p]Before you can absorb this awful idea, you hear a sharp [em]thwip[/em]. The rock beside you has split open.[/p]
        [p]You look up. On a ridge above you are hundreds of creatures. They look half-human, half-alien. Each one is different: some furred, some scaly, some slimy. They are armed with primitive laser-guns.[/p]
        [p]``Mutants!'' you cry. ``Let's get out of here, 2-Tor!''[/p]
        [p]``Right, Boss,'' he says, red lights flashing. ``But where should we go?''[/p]

        [p]You can't leave 2-Tor stranded. You grit your teeth, take a deep breath, and make your way back. The place is like a giant rat-maze, and you sense danger at every turn.[/p]
        [p]In fact, there [em]is [/em]danger. Mungoids are out in force, looking for you. They mean business, too.[/p]
        [p]Twice, you come face-to-face with them, and stun them with your micro-pulser. The only problem is that the effects of STUN don't last very long. Any Mungoid you knock out will wake up in a few minutes. It doesn't give you much time to act.[/p]
        [p]You keep calling 2-Tor. The communications system in your bio-support suit is connected to his. There's a lot of interference from the funhouse. But if you're close enough, he'll hear you.[/p]

        [p]``Hey, watch what you're-'' she begins, but she never finishes. The large and muscular alien has pushed her into a beam of bright blue light, where she stands transfixed, mouth open.[/p]
        [p]``That's a teleporter beam,'' 2-Tor whistles. ``I hope I can lead the frequencies in the beam, so we'll have some rough coordinates for her destination.''[/p]
        [p]``Quick, Tor!'' you urge him. ``Before she's gone!''[/p]
        [p]She fades away as you watch helplessly. You see a pleading look in her eyes.[/p]
        [p]``I have some very rough data, Boss,'' says Tor. ``hut the coordinates are unfamiliar. It must be somewhere outside the Network of Worlds. I can't be much help to you out there.'' Blue lights flash on his chest.[/p]
        [p]``Should we try following her there?'' you ask.[/p]

        [p]No, you're not! The ledge below you is moving - almost as though it were alive. You look down. What does this thing remind you of? That's it. A [em]tongue[/em]! You look down the ravine. All the ledges are slowly stirring. They're tongues, too. And they look hungry.[/p]
        [p]They don't seem very fast, though. If you move quickly, you might be able to hop from tongue to tongue. That would get you to the bottom.[/p]
        [p]Or you can use the thrusts in your bio-support suit to jet up to the top of the cliff. But who knows what surprises may be waiting for you up there?[/p]

        [p]You run for it, 2-Tor hovering along beside you. Laser blasts from the mutants land like hail all around you. The ground starts heaving again.[/p]
        [p]After what seems like a long time, 2-Tor begins to click and buzz. He has the coordinates figured for the [em]Challenger[/em].[/p]
        [p]``Let's warp out of here!'' you yell. And as you beat a hasty retreat, you see the earth open up exactly where you were standing.[/p]

        [p]Your relief doesn't last long, though. Something is very wrong here. For one thing, it's a mess. For another, the shuttle now appears to have a crew. It didn't have one when you left it.[/p]

        [p]At last it comes. 2-Tor communicates on your private cybernetic link. ``They're hijackers, Boss. Aliens from Pyxis. If we raise the oxygen level in the ship it will knock them out. You'll only feel giddy.''[/p]
        [p]``Can you take care of it?'' you ask him.[/p]
        [p]``Of course,'' he answers. Since he's hooked into the ship's systems, it's easy. In a matter of moments you're starting to feel a little dizzy. You begin to giggle for no reason, and you keep giggling as the aliens collapse to the floor.[/p]

        [p]``Correct, metal brain,'' says the alien. ``We're Florg, allies of the Kron. They do away with the ships' crews in The Cosmic Funhouse. We take the ships. A pretty good arrangement, don't you think?''[/p]
        [p]Hijackers![/p]
        [p]You must take action against this threat The moment you begin to raise your pulser, the imposter has his out. But 2-Tor, bless his metallic heart, has thrown up your energy shield before it even crossed your mind.[/p]

        [p]``That's not the whole story, and we both know it,'' you say. ``Tell me what happens to people here.''[/p]
        [p]It begins to laugh, knowing you're not really going to shoot it. But it didn't count on one thing: Its laughter sends you into a rage. Perhaps you [em]will[/em] kill it if it doesn't tell you the truth. The Ardanian stops laughing and starts to talk.[/p]
        [p]``Madness,'' it says. ``Sometimes they go mad. Or amnesia. Sometimes they die.''[/p]
        [p]Now you really feel like killing this heartless little creep. But you don't. You arrest it and call the [em]Nebula[/em]. You'll need a lot of help to clean up the Amusement Planet.[/p]

        [p]You follow the glow. As you get closer, it grows brighter - and you have trouble moving.[/p]
        [p]``Don't get too close,'' cautions Tor, blue lights flashing. ``This is a rare alien life form I've encountered before. It's a suspended animation entity, called a Mazdaw.''[/p]
        [p]``What's it doing here?''[/p]
        [p]``It's acting as a storage battery, draining energy from these people. I believe the energy is being used to run the funhouse.''[/p]
        [p]``Will a pulser-blast hurt it?''[/p]
        [p]``I'm not sure,'' says Tor. ``I suppose you'll have to try it.''[/p]
        [p]Finding it harder and harder to move, you inch closer to the light source. At its center is an alien with a shapeless body, glowing intensely. It's almost transparent. You can see its insides moving about.[/p]
        [p]You are getting close to total paralysis. You'll have to act fast, before it's too late.[/p]

        [p]You manage to get off one shot before you're rooted to the spot. You watch as the wounded alien begins to grow dim. As its glow gets fainter, you can hear the whole Cosmic Funhouse shutting down.[/p]
        [p]Now you can feel life coming back into you. The others in the room, too, are beginning to stir.[/p]
        [p]You warp these unfortunate people to safety. Then it's a simple matter to close down the human-powered Cosmic Funhouse for good.[/p]

        [p]You feel safe returning to the [em]Nebula[/em], even with a Kron fighter on your tail. ``2-Tor,'' you say, ``maybe we should transmit ahead and let them know they're getting company.''[/p]
        [p]``I already have,'' he reports. ``Ultra-secret frequency, of course.''[/p]
        [p]``Of course,'' you say. Sometimes it's hard, hanging around with somebody as perfect as he is.[/p]
        [p]You want to give the [em]Nebula [/em]a little more time to prepare. ``I'm going to try a little evasive action at warp speed,'' you say. ``Hold onto your hat.''[/p]
        [p]It sounds like a pretty good idea. But a few minutes of whooshing around space and your stomach has had it. 2-Tor, of course, is just fine, having no stomach to get sick to. Unfortunately the fighter is still right behind you. You pray that the [em]Nebula[/em]'s defenses are activated at Level A.[/p]

        [p]``I'll fight,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]Then you look more closely at the warriors. They're armed with a bizarre collection of old, new, and outlawed weapons from all over the galaxy. These guys seem to be the last ragtag remnants of a dying planet.[/p]
        [p]``I want to fight it!'' says one of the warriors.[/p]
        [p]``No, it's mine! I found it!'' screams another. More, of them enter into the argument[/p]
        [p]Dr. Caxton takes advantage of the fracas to edge closer to you. ``They're all bluff,'' she whispers. ``I've been watching them. If you act tough, they'll back down.''[/p]

        [p]Moving quickly, you get the drop on the Brakhen, grabbing it around the throat. Vinelike growths try to shake off your arms.[/p]
        [p]``What's going on here?'' you ask. ``Why are you holding these people?''[/p]
        [p]It makes a lot of funny noises. You don't understand until 2-Tor begins to translate.[/p]
        [p]``Nobody's holding anybody,'' the alien protests, ``except for you. Let me go, please.'' You drop your hands warily.[/p]
        [p]``This is a laboratory,'' it says. ``We're studying the human species here.''[/p]

        [p]``Why don't you let them go?''[/p]
        [p]``We have let them go,'' it answers. ``Strictly speaking, that is. These people are clones.''[/p]
        [p]``Clones!''[/p]
        [p]``Yes. When humans come to visit, we take small cell samples from them. We don't hurt them. They don't even notice. Then we produce these clones. We simply observe them scientifically.''[/p]
        [p]You don't like it at all. But have the Brakhen actually committed any crime?[/p]
        [p]After a brief conference with 2-Tor you reluctantly conclude that no law has been broken. You leave the planet - prepared to tell your story to the Network of Worlds.[/p]

        [p]A huge sign goes on above the machine. TILT. Sirens and alarm bells go off everywhere, and as you look down the long corridor, you see an amazing sight. Sign after sign is lighting up, on and on into the distance. They all say the same thing: TILT. The whole planet is on TILT![/p]
        [p]It's an easy matter for you to have Network reinforcements warped in, before the Kron figure out where RESET is.[/p]

        [p]The faceless monster keeps heading toward you. It seems to glide along, not touching the ground. You stand firm, praying that your gamble that it is an illusion is the right one.[/p]
        [p]You try a little light conversation to keep your spirits up. ``Hi,'' you say. ``Nice weather around here, isn't it? Ha-ha.[/p]
        [p]``Of course, you don't really know, because you're not really real. Ha-ha-ha. Are you?''[/p]
        [p]Your knees turn to jelly. They should: You gambled wrong. The faceless monster is no illusion, as you are about to find out.[/p]
        [p]Its single eye starts to glow. As it grows stronger, you feel the deadly white heat that spells your doom.[/p]

        [p]``2-Tor,'' you say, ``maybe we should-'' But you stop when you realize that no sound is coming out. You can't hear your own voice. Even your telepathic link with 2-Tor is cut.[/p]
        [p]You grope around, but your hands find only air. You aren't even so sure of the floor. You try hard not to panic.[/p]
        [p]After a while everything begins to seem like a dream. You lose all sense of time. You may have been here for a hundred years. You don't know up from down, backward from forward. You begin talking to people who aren't there.[/p]
        [p]Finally a bit of light trickles in. It hurts your eyes. Gradually you are able to make out two things: a door and a strange, rippling mirror.[/p]

        [p]Suddenly you have another problem. Zombielike, the people in the room are moving in on you. They don't look as if they want to shake hands, either.[/p]
        [p]This is a real puzzle. These people mean business, and their dead stares make them scarier than if they were awake. But how can you shoot them? They're being controlled by the image machine. They're not responsible for their actions. Even if your pulser's on STUN, it will hurt.[/p]
        [p]Suppose you reach the machine? It doesn't have a simple ON/OFF switch. Are you just going to start randomly twiddling dials? [em]Nebula [/em]regulations don't cover this situation![/p]

        [p]A blazing firefight ensues. Pulser-blasts are flying everywhere, bouncing off walls and ripping holes in the command module.[/p]
        [p]But you've started, and now you've got to finish. You're protected by your energy shield, but that won't last forever. Sooner or later your shield will give out. You fight on.[/p]
        [p]After about an hour the tide begins to turn. The aliens are being vanquished. Finally the last creature collapses on the deck.[/p]
        [p]``2-Tor!'' you yell. ``We made it!'' You spin around to clap him on the back, but he's not there. He is lying in the far corner, utterly destroyed. He gave up his last ounce of energy keeping your shield intact.[/p]
        [p]Tears sting your eyes. Sadly, you realize you'll have to pilot the shuttle back to the [em]Nebula [/em]all alone. You sit down at the console.[/p]
        [p]Your controls have been wrecked.[/p]

        [p]Your pulser set for BLAST, you turn to face the monster. At that instant you see something interesting out of the corner of your eye. It's a machine, and it looks something like the machine you left behind in the funhouse. Not exactly like it, especially with those snakes pouring out of it - but something like it. On an impulse, you turn your weapon toward it and blast.[/p]
        [p]As soon as you blast the machine, the awful scene around you changes. The colors get duller, and the monsters move more slowly. Before your eyes, the whole scene fades away, like a bad dream.[/p]
        [p]You are alone in the room you just left, alone with a wrecked telepathic image machine. No zombielike people, no aliens, no nothing. The whole adventure has been an illusion.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor appears beside you. ``Well, we know what's going on now,'' you say. ``Let's get back to the [em]Nebula[/em] and tell Captain Polaris.''[/p]

        [p]``We needs his parts,'' says the mutant leader. He's almost begging you. ``Don't you see? He has the last part we need, a capacitor for our teleported.''[/p]
        [p]``Why do you need a teleporter?'' you ask. ``And please point that laser somewhere else.''[/p]
        [p]``Well,'' he says, dropping all pretense of ferociousness, ``would you want to live on this horrible planet?'' You have to admit that you wouldn't.[/p]
        [p]``What are you all doing here?'' you ask him.[/p]
        [p]``The Kron sent us here,'' he explains. ``They can't stand the sight of mutants - of anything that's less than perfect. They banish us to this world, hoping we'll die. This is our prison, unless we can escape from it.''[/p]
        [p]``That's terrible,'' you say. ``2-Tor, can we help these people?''[/p]
        [p]``Of course,'' says 2-Tor, yellow lights flashing. ``We're Network operatives, aren't we?'' It's a simple matter to request [em]Nebula [/em]aid in transporting the mutants to safe quarters.[/p]
        [p]You leave the exile planet behind. The next day the Kron are rounded up by the Network of Worlds. They'll be arraigned on charges of cruelty to mutants.[/p]

        [p]2-Tor beams you up to the [em]Challenger [/em]in short order. But your problems aren't over yet. You've just strapped yourself into your seat in the command module when a deep rumbling begins to vibrate your insides. You look through the visisteel window before you. There, at point-blank range, is a Kron starfighter. Before you have time to catch your breath, much less throw up your shields, the [em]Challenger [/em]is rocked by a direct hit.[/p]
        [p]``What's the damage, Tor?'' you shout.[/p]
        [p]``I'm afraid it's the shield projector, Boss,'' he says. ``I can't do anything with it.''[/p]
        [p]``I'm going outside to reconnect the terminals. I might be able to get them working again.''[/p]
        [p]``Maybe,'' he says. ``But there isn't a second to lose. The Kron fighter is coming back.''[/p]
        [p]``It would only take a minute,'' you say. ``If I get a minute.''[/p]
        [p]``Or,'' suggests Tor, ``we may be able to make ft back to the [em]Nebula[/em], even with the damage we've sustained.''[/p]

        [p]``I'm getting bored,'' you call. ``I bet none of you has the guts to fight me.'' It doesn't sound quite as tough when Tor translates it for the warriors, though.[/p]
        [p]They stop arguing, as the one who ``found'' you turns to face you. ``Are you calling me a coward?'' he says. He goes for his neutron-blaster. You aim your micro-pulser. He blasts you off the face of the planet before you've even finished aiming.[/p]

        [p]Carefully you work your way to the pivot of the left-hand one. You climb on top, flatten yourself out, and work your way toward the end. As you crawl, you try to figure out your options.[/p]
        [p]From the top of the flipper, you can see the whole pinball machine. Way on the opposite end, outside the playing arena, are two arched doorways about fifty feet apart. The left-hand one is brightly lit, the right one dark. Nowhere have you seen a trace of the aliens.[/p]
        [p]If you figure the angles just right, you may be able to use the motion of the flippers to catapult yourself out of there. Those doorways look like your best bet.[/p]

        [p]This just increases the chaos. Terrible noises, blinding lights, total darkness, and nightmarish images bombard you. But the people have stopped in their tracks.[/p]
        [p]From the corner of your eye, you see the door open. Oh, great. Probably another Mungoid menace.[/p]
        [p]Mo! It's 2-Tor. ``How'd you get here?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``I switched to auto-repair,'' he says. ``Need some help here, Boss?''[/p]
        [p]``Turn this stupid thing off!'' you shout.[/p]
        [p]``No problem,'' he says. He moves to the machine, turns five or six dials, and punches a few buttons. The machine shivers. Smoke pours from its back.[/p]
        [p]``What'd you do?'' you ask in amazement.[/p]
        [p]``I told it to project an image of the universe before it existed. Of course it couldn't. It self-destructed. By the way,'' 2-Tor continues, ``I also figured out how to bypass the feedback system in the teleporter.''[/p]
        [p]``Way to go!'' you whoop. ``Now let's go home and tell them what's going on here.''[/p]

        [p]When you reach headquarters, the [em]Nebula[/em] is ready. A dozen fighters have been scrambled, and the Kron ship's frequencies are jammed so it's cut off from the funhouse.[/p]
        [p]The end comes quickly after that. The Kron fighter is captured, and its crewmembers are gently persuaded to talk.[/p]
        [p]Their story is an unpleasant one. The funhouse has been a base for a massive overthrow plot, with mindcontrol the key element. That's why all the crews have been returning changed, or not returning at all. They've been the subjects of Kron experiments.[/p]
        [p]It takes exactly five hours for the Network forces to crush the rebellion.[/p]
        [p]``You did a great job,'' says Captain Polaris. ``But you're in big trouble.[/p]

        [p]There he is! He's in the company of a low-level compo-droid. ``Tor!'' you shout. ``What are you doing? Let's get out of here!''[/p]
        [p]``I'm trying, Boss,'' he replies.[/p]

        [p]You don't have time to mess with this dim-witted hunk of meganium. You simply take out your micropulser and blast it.[/p]
        [p]You and Tor skim along at top speed, until you're at the edge of the populated area. The terrain gets rougher as you travel. You slow down, coming to a halt at the bottom of a sheer cliff.[/p]

        [p]``Where is 2-Tor?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``Oh, we have your robot,'' it says. ``We've been performing some interesting experiments on it.''[/p]
        [p]2-Tor! Blinded by rage, you lunge across the desk at the alien. ``Don't touch me!'' it screams.[/p]
        [p]And at the first touch from you, the alien utters a gurgle and keels over. ``Germs...'' it whispers with its last breath. ``Death...''[/p]

        [p]``Well? Aren't we going to go in?'' Dr. Caxton asks.[/p]
        [p]``No, thanks,'' you answer. ``I've learned all I want to about The Cosmic Funhouse.''[/p]
        [p]Instead, you return to the [em]Nebula [/em]to tell what you've learned.[/p]

        [p]You don't have to wait long. The Ardanian pops back into view, beckoning urgently to you and 2-Tor. You follow as it leads you to a quiet, secluded corner. ``You've got to help me,'' it begs. ``I'm a slave here!''[/p]
        [p]``Who's holding you?''[/p]
        [p]``The Brakhen. They need my telepathic powers to run their sideshow. I've tried to escape many times, but they always bring me back That's why I got you to come here.''[/p]

        [p]``Well, I had to do [em]something [/em]to get the [em]Nebula[/em]'s attention, didn't I?''[/p]
        [p]Even though the Ardanian has done awful things, its plight is a desperate one. Then again, you don't trust it as far as you can throw it. It may not even be telling the truth.[/p]

        [p]You and 2-Tor brace yourselves for the fight of your lives. You don't expect much help from the furry fellows you've been sent But you're wrong. They were just waiting for the odds to get interesting.[/p]
        [p]As the muscle mountain closes in, the Network agents suddenly straighten up. They are totally transformed. You have been sent two ace fighting machines.[/p]
        [p]These guys know martial arts from parts of the galaxy you've never heard of. Plus, they have nerves of kronium.[/p]
        [p]Within fifteen minutes the aliens are lying all over the floor, ft is a small matter to close the funhouse down.[/p]

        [p]``Shall we try to follow Dr. Caxton?'' he asks.[/p]
        [p]``Why not?'' you say. ``Just get us out of here!''[/p]
        [p]Tor whisks you and the furry guys into warp-space. You're off to the unfamiliar coordinates he's read from the transporter beam. Who knows what awaits you?[/p]
        [p]Pretty soon you're there. You wish you weren't.[/p]
        [p]You are standing at the feet of a forty-foot-tall, mean-looking fellow. He carries a whip as big around as your thigh. He has tusks.[/p]
        [p]``Welcome to Jarq,'' he rumbles. He flicks his whip.[/p]
        [p]``Jarq!'' 2-Tor beeps, his red lights flashing madly. ``The infamous slave planet. If only I'd known its coordinates! I'm afraid we're in trouble now.''[/p]

        [p]Suddenly 2-Tor stops what he's doing. Blue lights flash. ``I'm reading something very strong,'' he begins. ``An intense psychic force. Perhaps you'd better-''[/p]

        [p]You look over your shoulder just in time to see the fighter appear. [em]Wow,[/em] you think to yourself. [em]The Kron must have something big to protect, if they're coming after me with this much firepower.[/em][/p]
        [p]The fighter begins another round. This time it's going after you. Your suit shield will protect you for a while, but not forever.[/p]
        [p]``Tor!'' you yell to your partner inside. ``Fire a negatron missile!''[/p]
        [p]``I can't,'' he replies. ``Too close-range.''[/p]

        [p]Your shield is really taking a beating. It goes to yellow, and begins to glow a bright white.[/p]

        [p]``Great Galaxy,'' he replies. His blue lights flash.[/p]
        [p]The Cosmic Funhouse now bristles with pulser cannon and negatron missile launchers. The whole place is a heavily armed fortress![/p]
        [p]2-Tor, linking thoughts with the robots on other Network ships, is able to get some data for you. ``What we're looking at is an observation post,'' he says. ``It's an alien attack on the Network of Worlds.''[/p]
        [p]``Are we too late to stop it?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``I don't think so,'' he says. ``Watch this.''[/p]

        [p]Your needle beam is quite effective. As each attacker gets too close, you reduce it to a frizzle. But you can't hold out long this way. There are thousands of them, and they're getting crankier by the moment.[/p]
        [p]Firing in short bursts, you tear down the aisles, making for a door at the other end of the room. There's daylight coming through the crack at the bottom. Please, please let it be an exit to the outside![/p]
        [p]It is! You're free! Now if you could only make contact with Tor.[/p]
        [p]You feel a metallic tap on your shoulders, which nearly causes you to jump out of your skin.[/p]
        [p]``Only me,'' says 2-Tor, yellow lights flashing. ``I hope I didn't frighten you. I've repaired my circuits. Would you like to beam off the planet?''[/p]

        [p]The wall begins to glow red. As you keep blasting it, it goes to yellow. It's on its way to white, its final tolerance. But your pulser is running out of energy.[/p]
        [p]``Give me some more juice, Tor,'' you say. He does, and the wall heats up some more.[/p]
        [p]``More, 2-Tor, I need more! We're almost there!''[/p]

        [p]You've been shelling nuts for two days when a dark cloud blots out what little sunlight there is. Looking up fearfully, the warriors all rise together. They yell something, then pile into the sand-hover and tear off across the plain toward a solitary crag.[/p]
        [p]``What was that all about?'' you ask Tor.[/p]
        [p]``That cloud was a sign. They're off to see Armac, who seems to be some sort of oracle.''[/p]

        [p]``Details, details,'' you say. ``Why don't we just hotfoot it back to the [em]Nebula?[/em]''[/p]

        [p]``Any other ideas?''[/p]

        [p]You run for the solitary crag, wondering what you'll find there. You scramble to the top.[/p]
        [p]Assembled there are all the warriors, bowing before a rusted, ancient computer.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor establishes communication with the computer. ``[em]What is your designation?[/em]''[/p]
        [p]``[em]I am Armac,[/em]'' it replies[/p]
        [p]``[em]What is your origin?[/em]'' asks Tor.[/p]
        [p]``[em]State-Planet of Moloth,[/em]'' it says. You're amazed. That's from before the Network of Worlds even existed.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor spends some more time in a sort of huddle with Armac. Pretty soon, Armac comes out with a lot of beeps and squeaks. Immediately the warriors throw themselves at your feet.[/p]
        [p]``Tor, what did you do?'' you ask, amazed.[/p]
        [p]``Simple. I programmed it to proclaim you Warrior Lord.'' 2-Tor's yellow lights flash.[/p]
        [p]``Can you get it to help you figure out how to get out of here?''[/p]
        [p]``I already have,'' he replies. ``In just a few moments we'll be ready to go.''[/p]

        [p]You slam it behind you, panting, your mouth dry with fear. You have no idea what to do next.[/p]
        [p]The air in this room is warm and damp. The light hurts your eyes. Then you realize that there are thousands of plants here. And the plants are moving.[/p]
        [p]Out of nowhere steps an alien who looks like a mushroom. ``Quiet in the nursery!'' it lisps. ``You're waking them all up!''[/p]
        [p]``Waking who up?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``Our little pets.'' It narrows its little white eyes. ``If they get cranky, they'll eat you.''[/p]

        [p]Cautiously you open the door, stepping into the bright light of another world. For a moment you're blinded.[/p]
        [p]When you're able to see again, you look behind you. There's no trace of a door, and 2-Tor is nowhere to be seen.[/p]
        [p]You survey the scene before you. The far-off land looks like the endless plains of Alphard-4. But whatever is growing on it is bright red. The area right where you're standing is as flat as a pancake.[/p]

        [p]The warriors dismount from the hover, hustling Dr. Caxton before them. They seem to be as violent with each other as with the outsider, pushing, elbowing, and cursing. 2-Tor silently translates their speech for you.[/p]
        [p]``Well, well,'' growls one. ``Another off-worlder.''[/p]
        [p]``It will make a good slave,'' says another. ``Can I have it?''[/p]
        [p]``I'd rather make it fight,'' says the first ``Then I can kill it.''[/p]
        [p]``Let's make it choose,'' says somebody else.[/p]

        [p]Below you, you see a strange glow coming from the bottom of the ravine. It is a bright light that changes color all the time.[/p]
        [p]You head down toward it, hopping quickly from tongue to tongue. They make snatches at you, but they're too slow to get you.[/p]
        [p]At last you're at the bottom. Your eyes are nearly blinded by the light. Your ears are nearly deafened by the clangings and buzzings. Something very heavyduty is going on down here.[/p]
        [p]You stumble forward, smack into the bars of a cage. The cage is full of people, many of whom you recognize as missing crewmembers.[/p]
        [p]``Get out!'' they shout at you. ``Run!''[/p]

        [p]You take a flying leap at the drainer and start smashing it with your disappearing fists. You've surprised it. It didn't expect such a foolhardy, primitive attack.[/p]
        [p]Somehow you've managed to shock it out of its draining mode. It just sits there as you pummel it, becoming more and more transparent. You can see your own body coming back, and you can feel your own mind clearing. Finally the imitation is gone.[/p]
        [p]You look up to see 2-Tor coming through the mirror. He's been as disoriented as you, but managed to find you by following your electrical impulses.[/p]
        [p]Together you beam up to the [em]Challenger [/em]and warp off to the [em]Nebula [/em]to report on the dangerous beings inhabiting The Cosmic Funhouse.[/p]

        [p]You take a deep breath and set your pulser for STUN. It's you or them, and this won't do any permanent damage.[/p]
        [p]It's like shooting ducks in a pond. The zombiepeople move so slowly, it's easy to pick them off. They make no attempt to avoid your shots.[/p]
        [p]You're all alone with the machine now. The room begins to tumble end-over-end, and you hold on to the machine for dear life.[/p]

        [p]Suddenly the door flies open. Three Kron come storming into the room, leaving trails of slime behind them. Strange that they don't seem to be having any trouble with the room.[/p]
        [p]But they're obviously very angry. One of them communicates telepathically with you. ``[em]Let me show you what this machine can do[/em]'' it says, pulling a lever at one side of the machine. You don't think it's going to be a pleasant show.[/p]

        [p]``Welcome to the G.P.B.,'' says the other.[/p]
        [p]So that's what this is all about. The Galactic Peacekeeping Brigade, a ruthless vigilante group well known to the [em]Nebula[/em]. This has all been an initiation rite, to see if you're tough enough.[/p]
        [p][em]Nebula [/em]has been trying to bust this group for a long time. Now's your chance to be a hero.[/p]
        [p]You accept their invitation, making sure to get 2-Tor back. After a short time you're introduced to the head of the group, a brutal Kron named Shrazz. You and 2-Tor arrest it in the name of the Network of Worlds.[/p]

        [p]Your ears pick up a faint sound, coming from your left. A low whistling noise.[/p]
        [p]In moments the source of the noise is plain to see: a herd of tremendous fur-covered whistling red beasts. Great tusks curve high above their heads. They're going to steamroller you if you don't start running.[/p]
        [p]You tear along the strangely flat area - but suddenly screech to a stop. It just... ends. You're looking down a straight drop, too straight to be natural. At the bottom, about seventy feet down, is a red river.[/p]
        [p]You look around frantically. You're on the top of a gigantic cube, and the red river runs like a moat around it. Far below is another cube.[/p]
        [p]Some distance from you is a rickety little bridge, leading to the other cube. It might hold you.[/p]

        [p]It's a long way to Antares, and it takes several hours, even at warp speed. The fighter does not stay with you.[/p]
        [p]The [em]Challenger [/em]makes it safely to the Antares system, where you are able to assemble a force of combined local and Network ships.[/p]
        [p]A few hours later, you and your armada are heading back to The Cosmic Funhouse.[/p]
