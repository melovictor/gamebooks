    <text>{\fi0\qc Welcome aboard!\par}\par The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.\par You've just come aboard the space station \i Nebula\i0 , home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a \i Nebula\i0  operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.\par The \i Nebula\i0 's teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the \i Challenger\i0 . If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the \i Nebula\i0  for reinforcements.\par Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on \i your\i0  choices. Successful \i Nebula\i0  operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.\par Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you!</text>

  <p id="2">
    <text>Captain Polaris has summoned you - and when Polaris calls, you run. You're a bit out of breath when you reach the busy Teleportation Room of the artificial moon called the \i Nebula\i0 . Judging by your clammy palms, you're a little nervous, too. After all, you're still a new recruit.\par Polaris greets you with a smile. "I have a rather unusual assignment for you," he says. "It'll probably be more fun than training camp down on Centaurus A. But," he adds, "it may be a little more dangerous, too."\par "2-Tor and I are ready for some excitement," you reply. "What's the job?"\par "Have you ever visited the Amusement Planet?" he asks.\par "No. My parents always talked about going there, but we never got around to it"\par Captain Polaris turns to 2-Tor. "What do you know about it?" he asks.\par "It's a medium-sized planet" 2-Tor clicks and buzzes. "It's had its amusement function for about eighty years. Main attraction: The Cosmic Funhouse. It's all run by the Kron from the Algol system."\par "Where's that?" you ask.\par "Perseus. Triple star," he replies. "The Amusement Planet seems to have had its heyday about forty years ago. It's a bit run-down now. That's all the information I have."</text>
    <next id="3"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="3">
    <text>"That's all you need," says Polaris, "except for one thing. We've had some disturbing reports about The Cosmic Funhouse. Odd things: Whole crews disappear and nobody's sure where they are. Or they come back changed in subtle ways. Something funny is happening there, and I want you to take a look. Find out what's going on. If it's a danger to the Network of Worlds, put an end to it."\par You and 2-Tor climb aboard the \i Challenger\i0 . You set the shuttle's controls for the Amusement Planet.\par "Boy, it really is an unusual assignment," you whistle. "I wonder if we should try to sneak in there without being seen."\par "Or," suggests 2-Tor, "we could dress up as tourists and snoop around."\par The \i Challenger\i0  blasts off.</text>

  <p id="4">
    <text>As the \i Challenger\i0  orbits the Amusement Planet, you prepare to warp down. "We'll arrive in a big warehouse," 2-Tor says. "Mice and quiet."\par Unfortunately his information is a bit out of date. The warehouse is no longer there. You materialize in the middle of a huge crowd. Luckily, no one notices you.\par The Amusement Planet looks pretty much the way carnivals have looked for hundreds of years: harsh lights, all kinds of junk to eat, scary rides, loud noises.\par After a minute's walking around, 2-Tor edges close. "Don't look now, Boss," he says. "I have a strong sense we're being followed." You sneak a look behind you, but all you see is a pile of garbage.\par Then the "garbage" grabs you in an iron embrace. "Mungoids!" says 2-Tor. "Galactic thugs!"</text>

  <p id="5">
    <text>The beasts are too close. You hold your nose, close your eyes, and jump.\par Luckily you hit the water right and don't break your back. When you bob to the surface, a boat rows to you. It contains two Brakhen from the funhouse. "Congratulations," says the first. "You've passed the test."</text>

  <p id="6">
    <text>You and 2-Tor decide to be tourists. You leave the \i Challenger \i0 in the orbit sector for tourist vehicles, and warp down to the planet.\par "Well, Tor," you joke, "bring your microcam? You should send some pictures home to the folks."\par "What folks are those?" asks 2-Tor, who wasn't programmed with much of a sense of humor.\par The two of you walk around, observing carefully while trying to look nonchalant. What you see looks pretty harmless. Rides, games of chance, cerebrographology booths, the usual. But you sense an undercurrent here that you don't like. Something evil.\par Humans have the low-level jobs of attending the attractions. But the bosses are aliens. Kron and some of the plantlike Brakhen from the Megellanic Clouds.\par "May I make a suggestion, Boss?" asks Tor. "We might want to send for a xenologist"\par "A xe-what?" you repeat.\par "An expert in alien life forms. One might come in very handy, to let us know what they're doing, and why."\par "Sounds good," you say, "but if there's trouble, this xenologist might get in the way, or even hurt."</text>

    <text>You have 2-Tor send a request to the \i Nebula\i0 , and very shortly your xenologist beams in.\par Her name is Dr. Caxton. She talks a lot about observation and alienography.\par "Shall we have a look at the funhouse?" suggests 2-Tor. You both agree.\par You buy your tickets for the funhouse, wondering what to expect. As you walk in, the real world falls away. The funhouse is a world of illusion, of fantasy. Everything around you changes from moment to moment. You're in a desert, an ocean, the far reaches of drifting space. Your companions change constantly, too. You fight to remember where you are and who you're with.\par You \i do \i0 remember your mission, though, and it makes you nervous. "Let's get going," you say. "Poke around a little. Stir things up."\par Dr. Caxton disagrees. "I think that would be unwise," she says. "We should have a period of observation. We need more data on the Brakhen and their methods."</text>

    <text>You don't stand a chance against the Mungoid. Besides, this may be a good way to find out what's going on. "We give up," you say.\par The alien drags you to a large building. It has huge sealed portals made of protanium.\par "This isn't one of the regular attractions, is it?" you ask, shuddering.\par "Shuddup," the Mungoid replies, pushing buttons on a console beside the door. The door opens with a roar.\par What you find inside is staggering. It's a room the size of a hangar, with thousands of small glass booths in it.\par "2-Tor, what is this?" you gasp.\par "An extremely advanced teleporter facility," he says. As your eyes get used to the light, you see humans and aliens in various stages of teleportation. Some of them are already half-invisible, on their way to unknown destinations. None of the travelers looks as if they want to go.\par "Do you think you could break into the computer system and shut this thing down, Tor?" you whisper.\par "Possibly," he says. "But shouldn't we try to find out its purpose first?"\par The Mungoid shoves you toward one of the booths.</text>

  <p id="10">
    <text>You wrench free from the Mungoid and start running. You flash past ride after ride, face after face. Hands grab at you as you run.\par In desperation, you get an idea. The rides! You can use one to escape.\par The Rocket Ride has just loaded up, and it's already moving. You climb on. It cannonballs into the air, gathering speed.\par When the rocket reaches its highest point, you hit the propulsion system in your suit. Whee-oo! You're flying! You soar high above the lights and crowds, leaving them far behind.\par At last you land. All around you are barren cliffs and crags. You haven't looked behind you once.\par "Well, 2-Tor, I guess we lost him," you pant. "There's nobody here." Silence. "Tor?" He's not with you!\par It's suicide to go back and get him. But you can't just leave him with that many Mungoid.</text>

    <text>"Let's do this one alone, 2-Tor," you say.\par The two of you poke around, trying to look like any other innocent tourists. You even play a couple of games of boltbalk. You lose.\par Just ahead of you is an immense building. Mammoth arches beckon you into it. The sign above the arches says THE COSMIC FUNHOUSE.\par Just past the funhouse is a dark-looking tent. Its faded sign says SIDESHOW: THE HALL OF HORRORS.</text>

  <p id="12">
    <text>Maybe 2-Tor is right. You shouldn't come in and start busting things up right away.\par The Mungoid drags you and 2-Tor to the center of the room, where two booths stand empty.\par You turn to the Mungoid with your most charming smile. "Excuse me," you begin, "but perhaps we could talk about th-" The alien slams you into the side of the booth, then effortlessly picks you up and throws you inside. 2-Tor is thrown in beside you. Then the vacuum lock seals the door.\par Every cell in your body is tingling with energy. But the world is fading fast around you. In the instant before you dematerialize, you pray that you and Tor will end up in the same place.\par In the blink of an eye you've reached your destination. You look around warily. 2-Tor hovers beside you, thank the Galaxy.\par "Great idea!" you say. "That's the last chrome/dome time I take your advice!"\par "Wait," he whispers, ignoring your insults. "I'm picking up some seismic activity."\par You feel a deep, frightening rumble. It shakes the ground beneath your feet. It grows more violent until a crevasse opens up in front of you. Finally the earth stops shaking. But you don't.\par "I have a fix on our location now," says 2-Tor. "We're in Sector F8-347. This planet is a young one. It's going through constant and rapid geologic change."</text>
    <next id="13"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="13">
    <text>"You mean, this happens all the time?"\par "You got it, Boss," he replies.\par Before you can absorb this awful idea, you hear a sharp \i thwip\i0 . The rock beside you has split open.\par You look up. On a ridge above you are hundreds of creatures. They look half-human, half-alien. Each one is different: some furred, some scaly, some slimy. They are armed with primitive laser-guns.\par "Mutants!" you cry. "Let's get out of here, 2-Tor!"\par "Right, Boss," he says, red lights flashing. "But where should we go?"</text>

  <p id="14">
    <text>You can't leave 2-Tor stranded. You grit your teeth, take a deep breath, and make your way back. The place is like a giant rat-maze, and you sense danger at every turn.\par In fact, there \i is \i0 danger. Mungoids are out in force, looking for you. They mean business, too.\par Twice, you come face-to-face with them, and stun them with your micro-pulser. The only problem is that the effects of STUN don't last very long. Any Mungoid you knock out will wake up in a few minutes. It doesn't give you much time to act.\par You keep calling 2-Tor. The communications system in your bio-support suit is connected to his. There's a lot of interference from the funhouse. But if you're close enough, he'll hear you.</text>

  <p id="15">
    <text>The three of you walk around warily, as your xenographer jots down notes. Suddenly she is jostled roughly by a passing alien of unknown origin.\par "Hey, watch what you're-" she begins, but she never finishes. The large and muscular alien has pushed her into a beam of bright blue light, where she stands transfixed, mouth open.\par "That's a teleporter beam," 2-Tor whistles. "I hope I can lead the frequencies in the beam, so we'll have some rough coordinates for her destination."\par "Quick, Tor!" you urge him. "Before she's gone!"\par She fades away as you watch helplessly. You see a pleading look in her eyes.\par "I have some very rough data, Boss," says Tor. "hut the coordinates are unfamiliar. It must be somewhere outside the Network of Worlds. I can't be much help to you out there." Blue lights flash on his chest.\par "Should we try following her there?" you ask.\par "We could, or we could call the \i Nebula\i0  for help."</text>

    <text>You look around, taking stock. You have ended up on a moss-covered ledge, overhanging a steep ravine. Below you are many more green ledges, and at your back rises a steep cliff. You stand where you are, trying to calm down. At least you're safe where you are.\par No, you're not! The ledge below you is moving - almost as though it were alive. You look down. What does this thing remind you of? That's it. A \i tongue\i0 ! You look down the ravine. All the ledges are slowly stirring. They're tongues, too. And they look hungry.\par They don't seem very fast, though. If you move quickly, you might be able to hop from tongue to tongue. That would get you to the bottom.\par Or you can use the thrusts in your bio-support suit to jet up to the top of the cliff. But who knows what surprises may be waiting for you up there?</text>

  <p id="18">
    <text>Abandoning the mission isn't a glorious choice, but you've just about had it. You'll be glad to get off this miserable planet alive.\par You run for it, 2-Tor hovering along beside you. Laser blasts from the mutants land like hail all around you. The ground starts heaving again.\par After what seems like a long time, 2-Tor begins to click and buzz. He has the coordinates figured for the \i Challenger\i0 .\par "Let's warp out of here!" you yell. And as you beat a hasty retreat, you see the earth open up exactly where you were standing.\par Seconds later you arrive at the \i Challenger\i0 , breathing a deep sigh of relief.\par Your relief doesn't last long, though. Something is very wrong here. For one thing, it's a mess. For another, the shuttle now appears to have a crew. It didn't have one when you left it.\par A man dressed as first mate approaches you. "Good to see you back," he says, saluting.\par What's going on here?</text>

    <text>You and 2-Tor give chase to the Ardanian, knowing you'll probably be in for trouble when you find it.\par You round a corner and there it is. On its head is the telepathic link for the huge machine that runs the sideshow.\par "So you're in control of this thing," you say.\par "Welcome, \i Nebula\i0  agents," it says in its tiny, pinched voice.\par "How - how did you know?" you gasp.\par "I'm a telepathic being," it replies with a shrug. "So I also know why you've come - to find out about the funhouse.\par "Here is your answer. The sideshow can have profound effects on people. Sometimes they get a little disoriented. They act strange for a while. It's nothing to worry about. Nothing illegal is going on here."</text>

  <p id="20">
    <text>"I think we know enough right now," you whisper, out of the Mungoid's hearing. "Nothing good is happening here. Try shutting it down, 2-Tor."\par Blue lights flash on your robot friend. "This may or may not work," he says. "The machine may be tamperproof. Or booby-trapped."\par Suddenly there is a loud pop, and then a sizzling noise. 2-Tor! Oh, no! Smoke rises from him, and all his lights are off. The whole system, rigged with feedback circuitry, has blown out \i his \i0 useful circuits.</text>
    <next id="102"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="21">
    <text>You know you can trust 2-Tor to come up with an answer. So you stand there smiling dumbly at the intruder, waiting for the robot to give you information.\par At last it comes. 2-Tor communicates on your private cybernetic link. "They're hijackers, Boss. Aliens from Pyxis. If we raise the oxygen level in the ship it will knock them out. You'll only feel giddy. "\par "Can you take care of it?" you ask him.\par "Of course, " he answers. Since he's hooked into the ship's systems, it's easy. In a matter of moments you're starting to feel a little dizzy. You begin to giggle for no reason, and you keep giggling as the aliens collapse to the floor.</text>
    <next id="115">You have completed your mission</next>
  </p>
  <p id="22">
    <text>"Just who are you?" you demand of the "first mate," as 2-Tor flashes its blue lights.\par "Boss!" 2-Tor says. "My scanners show none of the crew are humans."\par "Correct, metal brain," says the alien. "We're Florg, allies of the Kron. They do away with the ships' crews in The Cosmic Funhouse. We take the ships. A pretty good arrangement, don't you think?"\par Hijackers!\par You must take action against this threat The moment you begin to raise your pulser, the imposter has his out. But 2-Tor, bless his metallic heart, has thrown up your energy shield before it even crossed your mind.\par You blast the "first mate." His image shatters like a mirror, and standing before you is an alien with about five hundred tentacles. The other "crew members," shedding their false fronts, leap to the attack. They are all armed.</text>

  <p id="23">
    <text>What action can you think of? You end up roaming the corridors of the funhouse, banging on walls and kicking in doors.\par Dr. Caxton accompanies you, halfheartedly doing the same. She'd rather be observing.\par She's just ahead of you, leaning on a blank section of wall. You don't believe your eyes.\par She goes right through the wall.\par You run to the place where she disappeared and try to follow her. But when your shoulder hits the wall, it's solid.</text>

    <text>As coolly as you can, you raise your arm. You level your pulser at the Ardanian's head, trying to convince yourself that you'll kill it if you have to. That way, it will be convinced, too.\par "That's not the whole story, and we both know it," you say. "Tell me what happens to people here."\par It begins to laugh, knowing you're not really going to shoot it. But it didn't count on one thing: Its laughter sends you into a rage. Perhaps you \i will\i0  kill it if it doesn't tell you the truth. The Ardanian stops laughing and starts to talk.\par "Madness," it says. "Sometimes they go mad. Or amnesia. Sometimes they die."\par Now you really feel like killing this heartless little creep. But you don't. You arrest it and call the \i Nebula\i0 . You'll need a lot of help to clean up the Amusement Planet.</text>

  </p>
  <p id="25">
    <text>You'll see that the Ardanian is punished later by a court of law. Perhaps you can also force it to make the crewmembers reappear. But meantime the first order of business is to set it free.\par Using its telepathic powers, the Ardanian leads you all over the planet. You unearth hundreds of telepathic slaves.\par Then you storm into the head office. A gross, grayish, Kron, sitting at a floating deskpod, looks up.\par "You're under arrest!" you snarl. "I'm a Network operative. Lots more from the \i Nebula\i0  are on the way. You and your funhouse are finished."</text>

  <p id="26">
    <text>The funhouse looks like a good place for evildoing. It's big and has no windows.\par You and 2-Tor head for the giant arches, ready for anything. As you stride through the doors, they clang shut behind you. 2-Tor's blue lights flash.\par "Uh-oh," you say to him. "This is very weird."\par There's nothing inside. Not just regular old nothing, but \i nothing\i0 . No light, no sound, nothing even to feel. Only the faint sound of the blood rushing through your veins.</text>
    <next id="63"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="27">
    <text>You race for the bridge, the beasts gaining on you. your lungs are bursting. The whistling sound is earsplitting. Almost there... a few more meters - Dive for it!\par You land on the bridge, panting. With a splintering sound it gives way. You grab for the rope handrail, but it rips loose. You're falling through thin air. You close your eyes.\par When you open them again, you're standing under the arches of the funhouse. Beside you is one of the Brakhen funhouse hosts. 2-Tor is there, too.\par "Have fun?" asks the alien pleasantly.\par "Fun!" you screech. "I could have gotten \i killed\i0  back there!"\par "Of course you could have."\par "Is that what happens to the people who don't come back?"\par "Certainly. It wouldn't be any fun if there weren't real danger, would it?" he chuckles.\par Aliens have a bizarre sense of fun, you think. You arrest them all for endangering Network citizens in their fiendish funhouse.</text>

  <p id="28">
    <text>You keep walking along, horrified by what you see. After a while 2-Tor speaks up.\par "I've analyzed these things, and they're not life forms at all. They're holograms. I believe the Kron have found a way to discover your own fear thresholds. These illusions are the most frightening things you can imagine."\par "Ugh," you say. "With all that scientific advancement, they use it for this revolting thing."\par A movement to your left catches your eye. You look harder, just in time to see an alien disappear around a corner.\par "Did you see that?" you ask Tor.\par "I think it was an Ardanian," he replies.\par "I should have known. Anyplace there's a little trouble to make. The weasels of the galaxy."\par "Perhaps it's just visiting," says 2-Tor.\par "Maybe this planet's made of green cheese, too."</text>

The mutants leap down from the ridge.\par "It's no use," says 2-Tor. "I'll put the shields up." But you've run out of time. The shields are only half up, and the mutants are opening fire.\par But they don't seem to be interested in you. It's 2-Tor they want.

He's been as disoriented as you, but managed to find you by following your electrical impulses.\par Together you beam up to the \i Challenger \i0 and warp off to the \i Nebula \i0 to report on the dangerous beings inhabiting The Cosmic Funhouse.</text>

    <text>You take a deep breath and set your pulser for STUN. It's you or them, and this won't do any permanent damage.\par It's like shooting ducks in a pond. The zombiepeople move so slowly, it's easy to pick them off. They make no attempt to avoid your shots.\par You're all alone with the machine now. The room begins to tumble end-over-end, and you hold on to the machine for dear life.</text>

    <text>Suddenly the door flies open. Three Kron come storming into the room, leaving trails of slime behind them. Strange that they don't seem to be having any trouble with the room.\par But they're obviously very angry. One of them communicates telepathically with you. "\i Let me show you what this machine can do\i0 " it says, pulling a lever at one side of the machine. You don't think it's going to be a pleasant show.</text>

    <text>"Welcome to the G.P.B.," says the other.\par So that's what this is all about. The Galactic Peacekeeping Brigade, a ruthless vigilante group well known to the \i Nebula\i0 . This has all been an initiation rite, to see if you're tough enough.\par \i Nebula \i0 has been trying to bust this group for a long time. Now's your chance to be a hero.\par You accept their invitation, making sure to get 2-Tor back. After a short time you're introduced to the head of the group, a brutal Kron named Shrazz. You and 2-Tor arrest it in the name of the Network of Worlds.</text>

    <text>Your ears pick up a faint sound, coming from your left. A low whistling noise.\par In moments the source of the noise is plain to see: a herd of tremendous fur-covered whistling red beasts. Great tusks curve high above their heads. They're going to steamroller you if you don't start running.\par You tear along the strangely flat area - but suddenly screech to a stop. It just... ends. You're looking down a straight drop, too straight to be natural. At the bottom, about seventy feet down, is a red river.\par You look around frantically. You're on the top of a gigantic cube, and the red river runs like a moat around it. Far below is another cube.\par Some distance from you is a rickety little bridge, leading to the other cube. It might hold you.</text>

    <text>It's a long way to Antares, and it takes several hours, even at warp speed. The fighter does not stay with you.\par The \i Challenger \i0 makes it safely to the Antares system, where you are able to assemble a force of combined local and Network ships.\par A few hours later, you and your armada are heading back to The Cosmic Funhouse.</text>
