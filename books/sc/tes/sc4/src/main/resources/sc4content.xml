        [p class="end"]Welcome aboard![/p]
        [p]The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.[/p]
        [p]You've just come aboard the space station [em]Nebula[/em], home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a [em]Nebula[/em] operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.[/p]
        [p]The [em]Nebula[/em]'s teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the [em]Challenger[/em]. If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the [em]Nebula[/em] for reinforcements.[/p]
        [p]Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on [em]your[/em] choices. Successful [em]Nebula[/em] operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.[/p]
        [p]Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you![/p]

        [p]``Come on, boss!'' 2-Tor says. You step onto the floating ramp that winds throughout the Nebula. The computerized ramp identifies you. Then it moves you into [em]Nebula[/em] Control. This is the nerve center of all [em]Nebula [/em]operations. Beings from a thousand worlds monitor a thousand vidscreens. They keep watch for trouble throughout the Network of Worlds.[/p]
        [p]``I'm glad to see you!'' Captain Polaris exclaims. His chair hovers over the controlroom. ``There's trouble in Space Sector X-7793A! No time to explain. You have to investigate. Get over to the warping bay. They'll brief you on your assignment.''[/p]
        [p]Captain Polaris taps the keyboard in his chair. Your destination is programmed into the [em]Nebula[/em] computers. The teleramp rolls you and 2-Tor toward the warping bay.[/p]
        [p]As you move out of [em]Nebula[/em] Control, the captain calls, ``Good luck! You'll need it!''[/p]

        [p]A small creature greets you at the warper room. Eyes rise on stalks from its tiny head. You recognize it as Dr. Zffrr, from the planet Epsilon 12.[/p]
        [p]``Suns are disappearing in Space Sector X-7793A,'' Dr. Zffrr says. He hands you a bio-support suit. ``You must find out why.''[/p]
        [p]The suit molds itself into a perfect fit around your body. ``It will protect you in space,'' Dr. Zffrr tells you. ``It has defensive weapons. A cybernetic relay lets you talk to 2-Tor with your mind. 2-Tor is linked to [em]Nebula[/em]computers, to access any information you need. He can warp you on command, if you have enough power. That robot is your best friend out there.''[/p]
        [p]Dr. Zffrr asks, ``Do you want to warp to Sector X-7793A? Or would you rather fly the shuttlecraft [em]Challenger[/em]? I'd suggest studying the problem. But I know you action types. Just make up your mind in a hurry. Nebula sensors show that another sun just blinked out.''[/p]

        [p]You trigger the [em]Challengers[/em] tractor beam. It pulls the Stellar Attack Team's weapons on board. The sunworm wriggles toward another sun.[/p]
        [p]You study the weapons. ``The only thing here that might be useful is a photon cannon,'' you say. ``This could destroy the sunworm. How close would I have to be to use it, 2-Tor?''[/p]
        [p]The robot's computers whir. ``Inside the sunworm, boss,'' 2-Tor says. ``Any other distance has a ninetynine percent probability of failure.''[/p]
        [p]``We're going in,'' you tell 2-Tor. You steer the [em]Challenger[/em] toward the sunworm. The propulsion units are on full. ``We'll get that monster before it knows what hit it.''[/p]
        [p]The shuttlecraft shoots into the sun. It rips through the sunworm's glowing skin. Heat beats against you. The ship will melt quickly. How long can you stand it?[/p]

        [p]``The warpoon has a megacycle charge in it, boss,'' 2-Tor says. ``Let's get out of here.''[/p]
        [p]``Right, Tor,'' you say. ``Beam us back to the [em]Nebula[/em].'' Bront comes closer and raises the warpoon. ``Hurry up, Tor.''[/p]
        [p]``I can't, boss. We aren't in our own dimension anymore.'' You stare out the nearest vidscreen. A milky gray blur has replaced the stars. ``This ship has shifted into another dimension. I calculate it won't touch our universe again for one hundred years.''[/p]
        [p]The captain stands over you and raises the warpoon. ``I'll give you one last chance, mate. Return to your post and I'll forget this ever happened.''[/p]
        [p]You raise your hands to surrender. ``Aye, aye, sir,'' you say. Bront's human lips form a smile. He walks away. He is lost in his madness again.[/p]
        [p]The hooper leads you to your new cabin. ``Look on the bright side,'' it says. ``Life isn't too bad here. And think of the story you'll be able to tell when you get back to the [em]Nebula[/em].''[/p]
        [p]``In one hundred years,'' 2-Tor moans. His lights have stopped flashing. ``In one hundred years.''[/p]

        [p]Smirking, the alien squeezes the trigger of its weapon. You must think quickly. ``Wait!'' you shout ``Take me to your commander! I want to join you!''[/p]
        [p]The Vend laughs cruelly. It pushes you through long corridors. You reach the commander's quarters. They are as cold as space.[/p]
        [p]For long minutes the alien and its commander talk. At last the commander says, ``The warriors of the Vend do not allow aliens into their ranks.'' You aren't used to being called an alien. On the other hand, this gray lump of a creature has never seen a human before. You are as strange to the Vend as they are to you.[/p]
        [p]``But...'' the commander continues. ``Tell us about the Network of Worlds' defense system! If you don't - [em]skrrrkl[/em].'' It runs its ragged claw across your throat. Your life depends on your answer.[/p]

        [p]You leap into the light of the unknown dimension. The starbody gives you a feeling of great power. The energies of the dimension of light pour into you. But you now have too much power. It tears the starbody apart. You dissolve into streams of light, a victim of the unknown dimension.[/p]

        [p]Explosions rock the hive. ``Warp us out of here, 2-Tor,'' you order. ``We may not survive in space, but we'll die for sure here.'' You fade out of the hive.[/p]
        [p]Suddenly you are floating in space. But your biosupport suit is damaged. ``The nearest safe world is seventy-three parsecs away,'' 2-Tor says. ``If we can't recharge, probability of warper failure recharge is ninetynine percent.''[/p]
        [p]``In other words, we'll never make it,'' you say. ``My suit is ready to fall apart. I don't think I can stay alive in space long enough to recharge.'' You already have trouble breathing.[/p]
        [p]``We could send an SOS,'' 2-Tor suggests. ``Probability of that failing is only ninety-eight percent.''[/p]

        [p]``The team leader has a good idea,'' you tell 2-Tor. ``Vector onto the starship's path.'' Suddenly you and 2-Tor are dragged into space at warp speeds. The astral winds rip at your bio-support suit, and stars look like blurs as you pass them. The Attack Team is far behind you now.[/p]
        [p]``What's happening?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``Trouble, boss,'' 2-Tor says. His warning signals flash red. ``The starship knows we're following it. It has us in a grabber beam. We'll reach the ship in thirty seconds, whether we want to or not.'' Sure enough the starship suddenly looms in front of you. ``A medium-intensity pulserblast will break us away from their beams.''[/p]
        [p]A bolt of light zips past you. You see that it wasn't aimed at you. Its target is the nearest star. You are still being pulled into the starship.[/p]

        [p]2-Tor whistles. His blue warning lights blink. ``The photon blast ruined my communications equipment, boss. We're on our own.''[/p]
        [p]You rev up the ship's propulsion system. But it just sputters and dies. The explosion has turned the shuttlecraft into a spacewreck. Only the sensors function. They tell you the sunworm is swallowing the [em]Challenger[/em]. The shuttlecraft begins to vaporize in the heat[/p]

        [p]The artificial sun moves close. ``With luck, I can get one good shot in,'' you tell 2-Tor. You trigger your micro-pulser.[/p]
        [p]The blast strikes the center of the sun. Ripples flow across its gaseous skin.[/p]
        [p]``I've got a new analysis of that thing,'' 2-Tor bleeps. All his lights are flashing in warning, but his voice is broken by static. ``It's not... warping... device...''[/p]
        [p]``Tor!'' you shout. Your voice echoes on your communicator. ``What do you mean? What [em]is [/em]it?''[/p]
        [p]``Living...'' 2-Tor crackles. ``Angry...''[/p]
        [p]The warning is too late. Solar flares shoot like fiery arms from the sun-thing. Radiation blinds you, knocking out your sensors.[/p]
        [p]Then the sun-thing engulfs you...[/p]

        [p]The monitors show a starsnipe swimming through space. The monster is larger than a dozen planets. Captain Bront's starship looks like a speck next to it.[/p]
        [p]``The starsnipe is heading for an inhabited star system,'' 2-Tor says. His red lights flash.[/p]
        [p]``We'll stop it, lad!'' Bront cries. ``I've waited centuries for this!'' He steers the starship after the monster.[/p]

        [p]The cyborg rambles on. ``We follow the starsnipe. The foul creature destroyed the homeworlds of every being on this ship. It tore me apart and made me the thing you see.'' He stares off into space. ``Somewhere out there is the great starsnipe. We hunt it! We shall destroy it! Not even death will stop us.''[/p]
        [p]``Excuse me,'' you say. ``Who are you?''[/p]

        [p]The monster twists. A rainbow of colors erupts from it, and it looks as if the sunworm is falling into itself. A flash of light as bright as a nova explodes from the sunworm. A new sun forms where the old sun used to be.[/p]
        [p]Something else appears, too. A face floats among the stars, smiling at you. It is filled with ageless beauty, and it thoughtcasts to you. ``[em]Thank you for keeping me alive. The sunworm was my old form. But I was changing into what you see now. I needed a lot of energy to do it I'm sorry I was so much trouble, but I'm very far from home.

        [p]``Do it!'' You can last only ten seconds in space without a bio-support. Ten... nine... eight... The absolute cold of space seeps into you, sapping your strength. Your muscles stiffen. Seven... six... five... You're gambling that you can live longer without life support than the sunworm can live without energy. Your lungs ache from lack of air. Four... three... two... The sunworm spins madly, cut off from its energy source. It is shrinking with every twitch.[/p]
        [p]Then it's gone. With less than a second to spare you switch bio-support back on. Air fills your lungs.[/p]
        [p]``Let's not try that again for a long time, boss,'' 2-Tor says.[/p]
        [p]``It's a deal,'' you reply. ``Send a message to the [em]Nebula[/em]. They'd better intercept that starship and stop it from creating more sunworms.''[/p]

        [p]A microsecond passes. You and 2-Tor are no longer in the [em]Nebula[/em]. You have warped through space. ``Let's see a starmap, 2-Tor,'' you say. The robot's vidscreen lights up with a chart of the area. ``There's a pattern. The blanks left by the missing stars form a triangle of circles. It's an interplanetary SOS.''[/p]
        [p]``Someone in Sector X-7793A needs help,'' 2-Tor says.[/p]

        [p]``Okay, boss,'' 2-Tor replies. ``It means we'll have to abandon the [em]Challenger[/em].''[/p]
        [p]``I know,'' you say, regretfully. When you come out of warp, the lightbolt strikes you. Heat blazes through you. The force swirls around you and begins to take shape.[/p]
        [p]``It's a sunworm!'' you gasp. ``Radiate the energy away before it destroys us.'' But it doesn't work.[/p]
        [p]``The sunworm's eating our power!'' 2-Tor bleeps. ``If we don't get rid of it, we'll have seventeen seconds left to live! Get out of range or cut off its energy! Do something!''[/p]

        [p]Then space itself begins to shimmer. Two gigantic, radiant creatures appear outside the [em]Challenger[/em]. They look as if they are made from the dust of stars. Their glow almost blinds you. One of them wraps a shimmering wing around the sunworm.[/p]
        [p]A voice in your head says, ``[em]Thank you for finding our child.[/em]'' It is one of the creatures. ``[em]He's just a baby. We're sorry for any damage he caused.[/em]''[/p]
        [p]Before you can answer, all three creatures vanish, streaking off into the unknown. ``That's the last we'll see of the sunworm,'' you say.[/p]

        [p]``Wait a minute, 2-Tor!'' you say. ``The sunworm eats energy. That's why it invades stars, right?''[/p]
        [p]``Correct, boss,'' 2-Tor replies. ``Why?''[/p]
        [p]``The attack team threw everything they had at the creature. Now it's bigger than ever.''[/p]
        [p]``Because they fed it more energy,'' 2-Tor clicks in. ``Observation. The sunworm is moving more slowly since the last blast. It may be reaching the limit of energy it can absorb.''[/p]

        [p]Bront leaps to his feet. ``Man the blasters! We'll finish the great beastie now!''[/p]
        [p]But he's too late. The starsnipe's teeth grind down on the starship, crushing everything inside. Captain Bront has met his nightmare, but you have paid the price.[/p]

        [p]You dash down long tunnels until you come to a dead end.[/p]
        [p]There is only darkness ahead. ``Analyze, 2-Tor!'' you order. ``That may be our only way out of here.''[/p]
        [p]``There is unusual energy,'' the robot says. ``I compute that this is a portal to another dimension. Data is insufficient to determine what lies on the other side.''

        [p]As the dark light from the negatoid's blaster smashes your shields, explosions rip through the hull of the spaceship. You are sucked through the hole into the vacuum of space.[/p]

        [p]``Go ahead,'' you say. ``I'm not going to stop you.''[/p]

        [p]``Something's happening to the starsnipe,'' 2-Tor says. ``My sensors show that it's breaking up. Bront is winning.'' On the vidscreen, you see the starsnipe plunge toward death in a nearby star. Captain Bront rides the monster and laughs wildly. Then both of them are incinerated in the heat of the star.[/p]

        [p]``Care to bet?'' you ask. 2-Tor covers his vidsensors. You rotate the [em]Challenger[/em]. Seconds before you'll crash, you fly the shuttlecraft into the docking bay sideways. Screaming aliens leap out of the way. Just before you smash against the back wall, you spin the shuttlecraft around. The [em]Challenger[/em] skids into the wall, but you are unhurt.[/p]
        [p]You and 2-Tor stagger out of the shuttlecraft. Ballshaped aliens, three feet tall, rush toward you. Before they can reach you, a thin, cruel face appears on a vidscreen in the docking bay. Three eyes, one above the other, stare from the face.[/p]

        [p]``It's a trick!'' you shout, as you access the [em]Nebula[/em] Attack Squad. ``Blast that monster out of the sky!''[/p]
        [p]The squad bombards the star with negatron missiles and anti-matter charges. The sun erupts, and collapses into a black hole.[/p]
        [p]The sunworm squirms, but it is caught by the black hole's awesome gravity. It disappears forever into the last of the vanishing suns.[/p]

        [p]``We're boarding that spaceship,'' you tell 2-Tor. The two of you rocket toward it. No one aboard seems to pay attention as you climb through an airlock into the ship. Once on the ship's bridge, you are puzzled by the crew.[/p]
        [p]``They're humanoids, Tor. But... it's as if they were photographic negatives.'' You brush your fingers warily on a crewmember.[/p]
        [p]You're thrown across the room. A nanosecond later Shockwaves and a loud roar hit you.[/p]
        [p]``Observation, boss,'' 2-Tor says. His blue lights caution you. ``These beings are made of negative energy. Contact with your positive energy could result in disaster.''[/p]
        [p]``Listen to the robot,'' a threatening voice says. ``Your suit saved your life, but my brother didn't have that kind of luck! He's dead - because you touched him!''[/p]

        [p]``Negatoids. We come from a negative universe,'' the being says. '``We need energy for our galaxy. The sunworm devours stars. Then it changes their energy from positive to negative, and transfers the energy to our universe. We can't permit you to interfere.''[/p]
        [p]``That's monstrous,'' you shout ``If you take all our stars, our galaxy will die.''[/p]
        [p]The negatoid shrugs. ``Your universe is unimportant When your worlds are gone we'll take over here, too. But you'll die long before your galaxy...'' A blaster materializes in the Negatoid's hand. ``Good-bye.''[/p]

The shuttle blasts into the sunworm's great maw. Its shields begin to buckle under the tremendous heat in the creature's belly. The [em]Challenger[/em]'s control panel is too hot to touch.[/p]
        [p]``Get ready to warp us out of here, 2-Tor,'' you say. ``I'm going to trigger the shuttle's self-destruct circuit.''[/p]
        [p]``We shouldn't warp, boss,'' 2-Tor beeps. ``Too much stellar radiation around. I can't compute a warp-out point. We could reappear anywhere - a planet's crust or right back here.''[/p]
        [p]``There's no time to plan, 2-Tor! Warp!'' Your hand slaps the self-destruct button. You're no longer there.[/p]
        [p]You rematerialize in space, millions of miles away. In the distance the sunworm shifts from color to color. It explodes, spewing gas and radiation throughout the sector. From where you hover, it looks like a beautiful exploding sun.[/p]

        [p]``Negation torpedo, boss,'' 2-Tor bleeps. ``Our shields can't stand up to it There's not a chance in Nyx we can outrun it. Abandon ship?''[/p]
        [p]``You said it, 2-Tor.'' Both of you leap through the emergency airlock.[/p]
        [p]The [em]Challenger[/em] vanishes in a soft puff of black light. Shock waves press you against the hull of the starship. You are still there moments later when erewmembers arrive to pull you from the hull.[/p]

        [p]``We'll find out what's going on a lot easier if we get ourselves captured, Tor. Put up shields only if they try to hurt us.'' The crew hauls you into the starship.[/p]
        [p]Soon you face the starship's captain. Half his body is human, but the other half is a machine covered with plastic skin. He glares at you with a computerized eye.[/p]

        [p]You try to move, but the Hive has stolen control of your body. A single spiraloid rises to your forehead. It unwinds to form a living link between you and the starbody. You feel your mind sliding down the spiraloid. In that moment you are one with the spiraloids and the supermind.[/p]
        [p]You imagine a horrible disaster. The Hive explodes in flames like a small nova star, scorching and slaughtering millions of spiraloids.[/p]
        [p]The vision is too much for the Hive. In panic, it lets you go, to slide back into your body. It may have been the stronger intellect, but you have the more powerful imagination.[/p]

        [p]``Scan the area, 2-Tor! Any trace of the Hive or the spiraloids?''[/p]
