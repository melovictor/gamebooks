    <text>{\fi0\qc Welcome aboard!\par}\par The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.\par You've just come aboard the space station \i Nebula\i0 , home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a \i Nebula\i0  operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.\par The \i Nebula\i0 's teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the \i Challenger\i0 . If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the \i Nebula\i0  for reinforcements.\par Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on \i your\i0  choices. Successful \i Nebula\i0  operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.\par Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you!</text>

    <text>"Come on, boss!" 2-Tor says. You step onto the floating ramp that winds throughout the Nebula. The computerized ramp identifies you. Then it moves you into \i Nebula\i0  Control. This is the nerve center of all \i Nebula \i0 operations. Beings from a thousand worlds monitor a thousand vidscreens. They keep watch for trouble throughout the Network of Worlds.\par "I'm glad to see you!" Captain Polaris exclaims. His chair hovers over the controlroom. "There's trouble in Space Sector X-7793A! No time to explain. You have to investigate. Get over to the warping bay. They'll brief you on your assignment."\par Captain Polaris taps the keyboard in his chair. Your destination is programmed into the \i Nebula\i0  computers. The teleramp rolls you and 2-Tor toward the warping bay.\par As you move out of \i Nebula\i0  Control, the captain calls, "Good luck! You'll need it!"</text>

    <text>A small creature greets you at the warper room. Eyes rise on stalks from its tiny head. You recognize it as Dr. Zffrr, from the planet Epsilon 12.\par "Suns are disappearing in Space Sector X-7793A," Dr. Zffrr says. He hands you a bio-support suit. "You must find out why."\par The suit molds itself into a perfect fit around your body. "It will protect you in space," Dr. Zffrr tells you. "It has defensive weapons. A cybernetic relay lets you talk to 2-Tor with your mind. 2-Tor is linked to \i Nebula\i0 computers, to access any information you need. He can warp you on command, if you have enough power. That robot is your best friend out there."\par Dr. Zffrr asks, "Do you want to warp to Sector X-7793A? Or would you rather fly the shuttlecraft \i Challenger\i0 ? I'd suggest studying the problem. But I know you action types. Just make up your mind in a hurry. Nebula sensors show that another sun just blinked out."</text>

    <text>You trigger the \i Challengers\i0  tractor beam. It pulls the Stellar Attack Team's weapons on board. The sunworm wriggles toward another sun.\par You study the weapons. "The only thing here that might be useful is a photon cannon," you say. "This could destroy the sunworm. How close would I have to be to use it, 2-Tor?"\par The robot's computers whir. "Inside the sunworm, boss," 2-Tor says. "Any other distance has a ninetynine percent probability of failure."\par "We're going in," you tell 2-Tor. You steer the \i Challenger\i0  toward the sunworm. The propulsion units are on full. "We'll get that monster before it knows what hit it."\par The shuttlecraft shoots into the sun. It rips through the sunworm's glowing skin. Heat beats against you.

"Beam us back to the \i Nebula\i0 " Bront comes closer and raises the warpoon. "Hurry up, Tor."\par "I can't, boss. We aren't in our own dimension anymore." You stare out the nearest vidscreen. A milky gray blur has replaced the stars. "This ship has shifted into another dimension. I calculate it won't touch our universe again for one hundred years."\par The captain stands over you and raises the warpoon. "I'll give you one last chance, mate. Return to your post and I'll forget this ever happened."\par You raise your hands to surrender. "Aye, aye, sir," you say. Bront's human lips form a smile. He walks away. He is lost in his madness again.\par The hooper leads you to your new cabin. "Look on the bright side," it says. "Life isn't too bad here. And think of the story you'll be able to tell when you get back to the \i Nebula\i0 ."\par "In one hundred years," 2-Tor moans. His lights have stopped flashing.

    <text>Smirking, the alien squeezes the trigger of its weapon. You must think quickly. "Wait!" you shout "Take me to your commander! I want to join you!"\par The Vend laughs cruelly. It pushes you through long corridors. You reach the commander's quarters. They are as cold as space.\par For long minutes the alien and its commander talk. At last the commander says, "The warriors of the Vend do not allow aliens into their ranks." You aren't used to being called an alien. On the other hand, this gray lump of a creature has never seen a human before. You are as strange to the Vend as they are to you.\par "But..." the commander continues. "Tell us about the Network of Worlds' defense system! If you don't - \i skrrrkl\i0 ." It runs its ragged claw across your throat. Your life depends on your answer.</text>

    <text>Explosions rock the hive. "Warp us out of here, 2-Tor," you order. "We may not survive in space, but we'll die for sure here." You fade out of the hive.\par Suddenly you are floating in space. But your biosupport suit is damaged. "The nearest safe world is seventy-three parsecs away," 2-Tor says. "If we can't recharge, probability of warper failure recharge is ninetynine percent."\par "In other words, we'll never make it," you say. "My suit is ready to fall apart. I don't think I can stay alive in space long enough to recharge." You already have trouble breathing.\par "We could send an SOS," 2-Tor suggests.

The astral winds rip at your bio-support suit, and stars look like blurs as you pass them. The Attack Team is far behind you now.\par "What's happening?" you ask.\par "Trouble, boss," 2-Tor says. His warning signals flash red. "The starship knows we're following it. It has us in a grabber beam. We'll reach the ship in thirty seconds, whether we want to or not." Sure enough the starship suddenly looms in front of you. "A medium-intensity pulserblast will break us away from their beams."\par A bolt of light zips past you. You see that it wasn't aimed at you. Its target is the nearest star. You are still being pulled into the starship.</text>

"The photon blast ruined my communications equipment, boss. We're on our own."\par You rev up the ship's propulsion system. But it just sputters and dies. The explosion has turned the shuttlecraft into a spacewreck. Only the sensors function. They tell you the sunworm is swallowing the \i Challenger\i0 .

    <text>The artificial sun moves close. "With luck, I can get one good shot in," you tell 2-Tor. You trigger your micro-pulser.\par The blast strikes the center of the sun. Ripples flow across its gaseous skin.\par "I've got a new analysis of that thing," 2-Tor bleeps. All his lights are flashing in warning, but his voice is broken by static. "It's not... warping... device..."\par "Tor!" you shout. Your voice echoes on your communicator. "What do you mean? What \i is \i0 it?"\par "Living..." 2-Tor crackles. "Angry..."\par The warning is too late. Solar flares shoot like fiery arms from the sun-thing.

    <text>"To battle stations!" Captain Bront shouts. You, 2-Tor, Bront, and Longhaul race to the ship's vid-deck.\par The monitors show a starsnipe swimming through space. The monster is larger than a dozen planets. Captain Bront's starship looks like a speck next to it.\par "The starsnipe is heading for an inhabited star system," 2-Tor says. His red lights flash.\par "We'll stop it, lad!" Bront cries. "I've waited centuries for this!" He steers the starship after the monster.\par "Let me call in a Network Defense Team to handle the starsnipe. It will destroy a ship like this."\par Bront snarls.

    <text>The sunworm doesn't answer, Tor," you say. "It must not be intelligent, after all. Signal the squad to attack."\par The Stellar Attack Team hurls all its power at the sunworm. Negatron missiles erupt in clouds of light. But the sunworm isn't hurt. Instead, it absorbs the energy. The attack team has run out of weapons.\par The monster twists. A rainbow of colors erupts from it, and it looks as if the sunworm is falling into itself. A flash of light as bright as a nova explodes from the sunworm. A new sun forms where the old sun used to be.\par Something else appears, too. A face floats among the stars, smiling at you. It is filled with ageless beauty, and it thoughtcasts to you. "\i Thank you for keeping me alive. The sunworm was my old form. But I was changing into what you see now. I needed a lot of energy to do it I'm sorry I was so much trouble, but I'm very far from home. Good-bye, and thank you.\i0 " The new creature drifts into space to join the rest of its race in a galaxy far, far away.</text>

"But I'm getting some weird energy feedback..." 2-Tor's words are cut off. The star with the hole dissolves into fiery splinters. They fade into the cold of space.\par "It's horrible," you say. "That star just \i collapsed.\i0 "\par "Boss!" 2-Tor cries. "The starship is changing course. It's heading right at us!"\par "Can we avoid collision?" you ask. Your scanners show an open docking bay on the side of the starship, but the bay is closing fast\par "Negative!" 2-Tor's yellow lights flash caution. "The starship is almost on top of us! Eighty-nine percent probability of a crash!"</text>

A glowing gas globe rises from the planet's core and surrounds you.\par The voice rings in your head again. "\i Welcome to our hive. Enter, human, and the secret of the disappearing stars will be yours.\i0 "\par "Can your sensors find the source of the voice?" you ask 2-Tor. Before the robot can answer, millions of tiny spiral creatures fly out to surround you.\par The voice says, "\i We are the voice.

The sun erupts, and collapses into a black hole.\par The sunworm squirms, but it is caught by the black hole's awesome gravity. It disappears forever into the last of the vanishing suns.</text>

    <text>"We're boarding that spaceship," you tell 2-Tor. The two of you rocket toward it. No one aboard seems to pay attention as you climb through an airlock into the ship. Once on the ship's bridge, you are puzzled by the crew.\par "They're humanoids, Tor. But... it's as if they were photographic negatives." You brush your fingers warily on a crewmember.\par You're thrown across the room. A nanosecond later Shockwaves and a loud roar hit you.\par "Observation, boss," 2-Tor says. His blue lights caution you. "These beings are made of negative energy. Contact with your positive energy could result in disaster."\par "Listen to the robot," a threatening voice says. "Your suit saved your life, but my brother didn't have that kind of luck! He's dead - because you touched him!"\par You wipe the smoke from your eyes and stare at the being who stands over you. "Wh-what are you?"</text>

    <text>"Negatoids. We come from a negative universe," the being says. '"We need energy for our galaxy. The sunworm devours stars. Then it changes their energy from positive to negative, and transfers the energy to our universe. We can't permit you to interfere."\par "That's monstrous," you shout "If you take all our stars, our galaxy will die."\par The negatoid shrugs. "Your universe is unimportant When your worlds are gone we'll take over here, too. But you'll die long before your galaxy..." A blaster materializes in the Negatoid's hand. "Good-bye."</text>

    <text>"Dying doesn't exactly thrill me," you say. You trigger the \i Challenger\i0 's thrusters. "But there's no time to think of a better plan." The shuttle blasts into the sunworm's great maw. Its shields begin to buckle under the tremendous heat in the creature's belly. The \i Challenger\i0 's control panel is too hot to touch.\par "Get ready to warp us out of here, 2-Tor," you say. "I'm going to trigger the shuttle's self-destruct circuit."\par "We shouldn't warp, boss," 2-Tor beeps. "Too much stellar radiation around. I can't compute a warp-out point. We could reappear anywhere - a planet's crust or right back here."\par "There's no time to plan, 2-Tor! Warp!" Your hand slaps the self-destruct button. You're no longer there.\par You rematerialize in space, millions of miles away. In the distance the sunworm shifts from color to color. It explodes, spewing gas and radiation throughout the sector. From where you hover, it looks like a beautiful exploding sun.</text>

A puff of light, like a tiny comet, rushes at you from the starship.\par "Negation torpedo, boss," 2-Tor bleeps. "Our shields can't stand up to it There's not a chance in Nyx we can outrun it. Abandon ship?"\par "You said it, 2-Tor." Both of you leap through the emergency airlock.\par The \i Challenger\i0  vanishes in a soft puff of black light. Shock waves press you against the hull of the starship. You are still there moments later when erewmembers arrive to pull you from the hull.\par "Do we attack, boss?" 2-Tor whistles.\par "We'll find out what's going on a lot easier if we get ourselves captured, Tor. Put up shields only if they try to hurt us." The crew hauls you into the starship.\par Soon you face the starship's captain. Half his body is human, but the other half is a machine covered with plastic skin. He glares at you with a computerized eye.\par "\i He's a cyborg,\i0 " 2-Tor thoughtcasts to you.\par "Shhh!" you say. "He's going to speak!"</text>
