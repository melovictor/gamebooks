    <text>{\fi0\qc Welcome aboard!\par}\par The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.\par You've just come aboard the space station \i Nebula\i0 , home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a \i Nebula\i0  operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.\par The \i Nebula\i0 's teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the \i Challenger\i0 . If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the \i Nebula\i0  for reinforcements.\par Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on \i your\i0  choices. Successful \i Nebula\i0  operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.\par Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you!</text>

    <text>You enter the nerve center of the \i Nebula\i0  and go up to the floating command chair, expecting to see Captain Polaris. But the chair is empty.\par "Come over here!" the captain orders. He is standing by one of the thousands of vidscreens in the room. On the screen is a large space station against a background of stars. "Recognize it?" Polaris asks.\par "The Cosmos Industrial Station," you say.\par "We have intelligence that Cosmos Station will be attacked by the battle cruiser \i Darkstar\i0 . Maybe you know of the cruiser's commander, Cypor Scarp," Polaris says. "Ever since Scarp and his gang of galactic misfits emerged from the Thonex star cluster, they've destroyed seven worlds."\par "Why attack Cosmos?" you ask.\par "The station is developing a new person, the Graviton."\par You turn to 2-Tor. "Information."\par 2-Tor's silvery voice recites, "Research files classified-Security Level Q-38 clearance." A click, then it goes on. "Graviton increases planetary masses dramatically. Tests show a 98.3% chance that it will turn planets into black holes. Tough stuff, boss."\par "A world-killing weapon!" you gasp.\par "Your job is to keep it out of Scarp's hands!" Polaris says.</text>

  <p id="3">
    <text>You and 2-Tor rush to the Teleportation Room, where you get ready to beam out on priority clearance. Suddenly a vidscreen comes to life, and Captain Polaris's face appears.\par "Our deep-space communications net has picked up a message. Mindor-6, the nearest planet to Cosmos, has been overrun. We have no other information."\par "Maybe it's Scarp, setting up an advance base to attack Cosmos," you say. "I wonder if we should check it out."</text>

    <text>"Only fools would choose to have their heads squeezed flatter than a Raxian panworm," says 2-Tor.\par "I'll talk," you shout. "Just let us out." The wall before you slides up with a clang. You find yourself staring at the shining, scaly face of the fiendish Slee from Zard. Slee looks at your uniform, a smile slowly forming on his crooked, bony lips.\par "All right, \i Nebula\i0  spy," he says. "Where is the data chip with your orders?"</text>
    <next id="5"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="5">
    <text>You hold out a data chip in the palm of your hand, "Here it is." you say. "You'll find it quite detailed."\par But as Slee is about to snatch it from your hand, you let it drop to the floor. He bends down to pick the chip up and you give him a chop across the back of his neck.\par The tyrant drops, stunned, to the floor of the cell. Before he comes to, you and 2-Tor locate the cell controls. You slam the door shut, trapping Slee inside. "Signal \i Nebula\i0  that Slee from Zard has been captured," you say. "Mindor-6 is free."</text>

    <text>Is the man really a criminal? Undecided, you watch as the cyborg knocks the man cold with a single burst from his blaster.\par "It's good you didn't interfere," says the cyborg. "I might have had to shoot you too."\par "We wouldn't have liked that," says 2-Tor.\par "Nor would my boss," says the cyborg. He pointed the blaster at you. "You two will make fine workers in the kronium pits of Mindor. From now on you're the slaves of Slee from Zard."\par "Slaves?" you say.\par "Kronium pits?" says 2-Tor.\par "Move!" says the cyborg. \par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

    <text>"You must take the Graviton," the alien mumbles. "Just be careful to take the right hatch. The wrong hatch will lead to..."\par You shake the alien, but it's unconscious. You look at the two round hatches set in the wall. One is marked with the symbols meaning "exit" in Galactic Interlanguage.\par The other hatch carries a strange symbol. You look at 2-Tor. He rotates his head. No answer.</text>

    <text>2-Tor channels full power to your micro-pulser. You aim and fire at the center of the panel. In a millisecond it heats white-hot, then explodes.\par The three of you step into the smoking room. You find that the blast has knocked out the cyborgs inside and shattered the teleporter controls.\par "This station will be out of commission for a long time," says 2-Tor. "Slee from Zard is in for a big surprise."\par So are you. The blast brings more Zardian cyborgs. They surround the building and fire a barrage of energy-bolts at you. Your shields flare as the heavy fire begins to overwhelm them.\par "You've got to do something!" Calix yells.\par "Just wait." You look at the sky. Starfighters swoop down, blasting the cyborgs.\par "A \i Nebula\i0  Attack Team. When they finish with the troops, they'll take Slee into custody." You laugh. "I bet he didn't count on that when he made his plans."\par 2-Tor's yellow lights flash. "What he didn't count on was meeting you, boss."</text>

    <text>You step through the charred entrance and into a dark, windowless room. The place looks empty.\par "Everybody's gone," says Bishra.\par The room suddenly fills with blinding light.\par "Everybody's gone but us slave-catchers," someone cackles. "Slee will pay us a pretty googol for such a fine bunch."\par "What's going on?" you ask desperately.\par "They're going to sell us as slaves," Bishra says. "I'm afraid we're heading for the mines."\par "But I'm a \i Nebula\i0  operative," you say. "I'm no miner."\par "Don't worry," laughs the slave-catcher.

    <text>You roll the \i Challenger\i0  180 degrees and drop down under the massive \i Darkstar\i0 .\par "Let's aim for the nose of the ship," you say. "A negatron missile will knock out the maneuvering thrusters."\par 2-Tor beeps. "Okay, boss," he says. "But first we'd better knock off that defense fighter they just launched. She's coming our way at near light-speed."</text>

  <p id="11">
    <text>You raise your arm, ready to squeeze off a pulse from your micro-pulser. But before the thought can travel from your brain, your pulser shatters into a million pieces.\par "Fight fair," says the woman. "No pulsers are permitted. If you want to reach Andron-Poc, you'll first have to defeat me. Choose your weapon: laser sword or energy-net?"\par You look about but don't see either the sword or the net.\par "I said choose!" she commands.</text>

    <text>You pick up the Cube in your claws and wing back through the energy field. 2-Tor doesn't recognize you in your new shape, but luckily, he sees the Cube. That gives the robot a hint that you and the winged creature are connected. Then he makes a detailed scan of his language banks till he turns up one you both can speak.\par Together you race out of the Forbidden City. The waiting mutants are overjoyed. They take the Cube and use its knowledge to turn you back to your former self. "We're grateful to you for the Crystal Cube," they say.\par "And I'm grateful for the knowledge in the Cube." Even as you speak, your wings wither away to be replaced by your familiar arms.\par In a brief ceremony the mutants make you and 2-Tor heroes of their new republic.\par 2-Tor manages a subspace link with \i Nebula\i0  control. You're heroes there, too.\par "Thought we'd lost you!" Captain Polaris says. "I sent you some backup. They saved the Graviton, but couldn't find any trace of you. Sit tight. We're organizing the rescue party right now."</text>

    <text>A week passes. Nearly one hundred troops assemble in the programming compound to try out their new battle suits. As soon as the suits are on, you give them the signal to attack. They turn on the surprised guards, overpowering them.\par Then you send your controlled cyborgs outside the compound. They march forward to destroy Slee's battle suit factory. The Zardian defense forces run.\par When that battle is over, you contact the \i Nebula\i0  for reinforcements. Meanwhile your troops are busy deploying the orbital defense control bases.\par By the time \i Nebula\i0  Attack Teams arrive Zard is defenseless. And Slee is a prisoner in his palace. All it cost you was four sleepless days and nights, controlling your cyborgs.\par You look forward to a rest, but Captain Polaris has other ideas. "We want you back on duty as soon as possible," he says.\par "I guess we won't be getting much of a break," you say to 2-Tor.\par He gives a happy whistle. "I wonder what kind of adventure Polaris has waiting for us next, boss."</text>

  <p id="14">
    <text>The only thing you want to do on Zard is destroy Slee's factory. Unfortunately that's not a job currently being offered. "We'll choose the chip room, whatever that is," you say.\par The cyborg guard leads you into a small room. He points a strange-looking gun at you.\par "We're making micro-microchips here," he says. "So we need micro workers. Prepare to be shrunk!"\par Before you can say a word, the cyborg sprays you and 2-Tor with the gun. You begin to shrink away like a balloon with a slow leak.</text>
    <next id="37"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="15">
    <text>You float silently through the airlock. Ahead is a hatch, which you open. You step into a room with a high silver dome. It's bare except for a single control bank in the center of the room.\par You turn to 2-Tor. "We got in slick as a Vegan prat-beast," you whisper.\par Then you hear a booming voice. "Kneel down, \i Nebula\i0  slime. Prepare to meet the great and mighty Cypor Scarp."</text>
    <next id="18"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="16">
    <text>With \i Darkstar\i0 's commander in your sights, all you can think of is trying to finish him off. You zero in on the battle cruiser's bridge. "Fire one!" A round of negatron missiles flashes at the battle cruiser.\par But Scarp is not meekly sitting by. He's firing, too. His huge quark cannons are locked on your little ship.\par 2-Tor's lights flash red. "There's no way we can slip through this kind of firepower!" The ship's energy shields flare.\par Your assault is doomed to failure. And you are just plain doomed. \par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

    <text>"I don't like the idea of giving up," you tell 2-Tor. "But in this case it could work to our advantage."\par 2-Tor whistles. "I hope you're right, boss."\par You send out a white surrender flare and cut your engines.\par Before long the ugly face of Slee from Zard fills your screen.\par "I'm warping in to take over your ship," he says. "And I'm bringing a squad of cyborg guards with me. They're heavily armed. So no tricks."\par "Everything is going our way," you say.\par "It is?" 2-Tor squeals.</text>

  <p id="18">
    <text>A panel at the rear of the room slides open. Cypor Scarp walks in. He's hardly the frightening creature you were expecting. In fact, he's only three feet tall. The only upsetting thing about him is his head. It's egg-shaped, and half of it is nothing but scar tissue. Somewhere in his career he met an unfriendly laser beam.\par "I'll take the Graviton now," he says. "Bring it to me."\par You grip the Graviton tightly. Suddenly you're taught that size isn't everything. A beam of purple light, nearly ultraviolet, flashes from Scarp's eye. The light somehow snatches the Graviton right into Scarp's arms.\par "Mice trick, eh?" Scarp removes the patch from his other eyes. "Now feel the wrath of my eyes displacer."\par You remember the nearby control bank.</text>

    <text>The woman introduces herself as Bishra. She guides you through the ruins of the capital until you come to a low domed building with a blasted door.\par "That's strange," says Bishra. "The door wasn't burned when I left here earlier."\par "Maybe we'd better not go in." 2-Tor clicks and buzzes wildly. "There's a high probability it's a trap."\par But my friends in there may need me," Bishra says.</text>

    <text>You grab one of 2-Tor's claws and lead him into the black, leafless forest.\par You look around. A sense of evil fills the landscape. Even the air tastes odd - like metal. You touch a tree; It crumbles into dark gray ash. "Charred in a nuclear firestorm," 2-Tor says.\par "Tor, let's get out of here." You must jump to regain your balance as the ground shifts under your feet. "Warp us home."\par Your robot friend clicks and buzzes for a few moments. "Sorry, boss, I have no idea where you are. This planet isn't in my sector circuits."\par You stare at the ruined countryside. "How can we ever survive in a place like this?"\par You can't. Moments later the charred earth opens up. Screaming, you fall into the jaws of an underground monster. It had been waiting for someone to drop by. Unhappily, you and 2-Tor obliged. \par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

  <p id="22">
    <text>"No time for the Cube now," you say. "That thing has given me enough trouble."\par A flap of wings brings you into the air, and through the hole in the flames. 2-Tor stands beyond.\par "Tor, it's me," you try to say. But the robot doesn't understand your mutant screeches. Right now, he doesn't even want to learn. He's too busy wondering what happened to his friend inside the wall of fire.\par After hours of circling 2-Tor, you give up hope. You take a sad backward look at 2-Tor, then you flap away. You must find a new home, somewhere in the outlands of the mutant planet. \par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

    <text>"I can only hold the energy field for a moment, then I'll have to recharge," 2-Tor says. A blue ray flashes from him and strikes the wall of fire. The ray blazes a tunnel through the flames.\par You take a deep breath and dash through the inferno. When you get to the other side, you see a shining pillar. Sitting atop the column is a brick-sized hunk of crystal. "The Crystal Cube of Knowledge!" you whisper.\par Before you can seize the crystal, something moves. A small, glowing, slick-winged creature swoops down darting a stinger into your exposed hand. Instantly, the hand goes numb.\par "Tor!" you shout. "Help me! What do I do now? How will I find a cure?"\par You wait for a reply. None comes. The firestorm has totally cut communications.</text>

    <text>"Fine," you say. "The faster she's coming in, the better."\par You jam your engines into reverse. In less than a second the enemy craft passes over you. It couldn't even get off a shot.\par "Fire!" Your negatron missile catches the enemy fighter from behind. A bright flash, then it's gone.\par Now you attack the \i Darkstar\i0  itself. Your shots knock out the battle cruiser's maneuvering jets. Darkstar is helpless to defend herself.\par In moments a surrender flare shoots from the bridge of the ship. Your skill and bravery has defeated Scarp's dreams of conquest.\par You smile at 2-Tor. Yellow lights flicker on the robot "Good work, boss. What next?"</text>

  <p id="25">
    <text>"By the asteroids of Katar ...!" you exclaim. Then you freeze. A mysterious force has invaded your mind. Sight, hearing, touch disappear as the force moves along your brain paths. Even your memories are invaded and probed.\par At last the voice speaks again. "You may pass and claim the Crystal Cube. I know you will use it wisely."\par You leave the city with the Crystal Cube. The mutant citizens greet you as a hero. "Stay and help us rebuild our world!" they beg.\par All this flatters you, but you refuse. You and 2-Tor must return to the \i Nebula\i0 .

    <text>"I think the squares with the vertical stripes are solid," you say.\par "I'll take your word for it, boss." 2-Tor gives two clicks and a buzz. "I just hope you have a good memory."\par Fortunately you do. The squares hold. You hop to safety on the far side of the checkerboard.\par Later you channel the rest of 2-Tor's energy into his transmitter and send a message to the \i Nebula\i0 . "I'll tell them our coordinates. Then they can come and rescue us," says 2-Tor.\par "Let's not forget to tell them about Mindor-6. That way, we can defeat Slee's plans too," you add.\par Captain Polaris himself gets on the communications link. "We'll take care of Slee," he says.\par "Good," you say. "Just don't forget to take care of us too."\par "Don't worry about that," says Polaris. "We'd never leave top aces like you and 2-Tor stranded. See you soon."\par "Very soon, I hope," you say.

Then you realize that you are the dummy. Inside sits a scaly, green-faced creature - Slee from Zard.\par "Seize them, master!" Calix Dune cries.

An eight-foot creature with bristling neon hair struggles with a terrified human in a white lab coat. The creature's toothy jaw juts out as it strangles the man. They're both bent over a portable teleporter device.\par "Stop him! Stop him!" screams the man. "We can't let him get control of the teleporter!
