        [p class="end"]Welcome aboard![/p]
        [p]The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.[/p]
        [p]You've just come aboard the space station [em]Nebula[/em], home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a [em]Nebula[/em] operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.[/p]
        [p]The [em]Nebula[/em]'s teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the [em]Challenger[/em]. If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the [em]Nebula[/em] for reinforcements.[/p]
        [p]Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on [em]your[/em] choices. Successful [em]Nebula[/em] operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.[/p]
        [p]Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you![/p]

        [p]You enter the nerve center of the [em]Nebula[/em] and go up to the floating command chair, expecting to see Captain Polaris. But the chair is empty.[/p]
        [p]``Come over here!'' the captain orders. He is standing by one of the thousands of vidscreens in the room. On the screen is a large space station against a background of stars. ``Recognize it?'' Polaris asks.[/p]
        [p]``The Cosmos Industrial Station,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]``We have intelligence that Cosmos Station will be attacked by the battle cruiser [em]Darkstar[/em]. Maybe you know of the cruiser's commander, Cypor Scarp,'' Polaris says. ``Ever since Scarp and his gang of galactic misfits emerged from the Thonex star cluster, they've destroyed seven worlds.''[/p]
        [p]``Why attack Cosmos?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``The station is developing a new person, the Graviton.''[/p]
        [p]You turn to 2-Tor. ``Information.''[/p]
        [p]2-Tor's silvery voice recites, ``Research files classified-Security Level Q-38 clearance.'' A click, then it goes on. ``Graviton increases planetary masses dramatically. Tests show a 98.3% chance that it will turn planets into black holes. Tough stuff, boss.''[/p]
        [p]``A world-killing weapon!'' you gasp.[/p]
        [p]``Your job is to keep it out of Scarp's hands!'' Polaris says.[/p]

        [p]You and 2-Tor rush to the Teleportation Room. Where you get ready to beam out on priority clearance. Suddenly a vidscreen comes to life, and Captain Polaris's face appears.[/p]
        [p]``Our deep-space communications net has picked up a message. Mindor-6, the nearest planet to Cosmos, has been overrun. We have no other information.''[/p]
        [p]``Maybe it's Scarp, setting up an advance base to attack Cosmos,'' you say. ``I wonder if we should check it out.''[/p]
    </text>
    <next id="78">Do you wish to warp directly to Cosmos?</next>
    <next id="56">Would you rather take your shuttlecraft, the Challenger and head for Mindor-6?</next>

        [p]``Only fools would choose to have their heads squeezed flatter than a Raxian panworm,'' says 2-Tor.[/p]
        [p]``I'll talk,'' you shout. ``Just let us out.'' The wall before you slides up with a clang. You find yourself staring at the shining, scaly face of the fiendish Slee from Zard. Slee looks at your uniform, a smile slowly forming on his crooked, bony lips.[/p]
        [p]``All right, [em]Nebula[/em] spy,'' he says. ``Where is the data chip with your orders?''[/p]

        [p]You hold out a data chip in the palm of your hand, ``Here it is.'' you say. ``You'll find it quite detailed.''[/p]
        [p]But as Slee is about to snatch it from your hand, you let it drop to the floor. He bends down to pick the chip up and you give him a chop across the back of his neck.[/p]
        [p]The tyrant drops, stunned, to the floor of the cell. Before he comes to, you and 2-Tor locate the cell controls. You slam the door shut, trapping Slee inside. ``Signal [em]Nebula[/em] that Slee from Zard has been captured,'' you say. ``Mindor-6 is free.''[/p]

        [p]Is the man really a criminal? Undecided, you watch as the cyborg knocks the man cold with a single burst from his blaster.[/p]
        [p]``It's good you didn't interfere,'' says the cyborg. ``I might have had to shoot you too.''[/p]
        [p]``We wouldn't have liked that,'' says 2-Tor.[/p]
        [p]``Nor would my boss,'' says the cyborg. He pointed the blaster at you. ``You two will make fine workers in the kronium pits of Mindor. From now on you're the slaves of Slee from Zard.''[/p]
        [p]``Slaves?'' you say.[/p]
        [p]``Kronium pits?'' says 2-Tor.[/p]
        [p]``Move!'' says the cyborg.[/p]

        [p]``You must take the Graviton,'' the alien mumbles. ``Just be careful to take the right hatch. The wrong hatch will lead to...''[/p]
        [p]You shake the alien, but it's unconscious. You look at the two round hatches set in the wall. One is marked with the symbols meaning ``exit'' in Galactic Interlanguage.[/p]
        [p]The other hatch carries a strange symbol. You look at 2-Tor. He rotates his head. No answer.[/p]

        [p]2-Tor channels full power to your micro-pulser. You aim and fire at the center of the panel. In a millisecond it heats white-hot, then explodes.[/p]
        [p]The three of you step into the smoking room. You find that the blast has knocked out the cyborgs inside and shattered the teleporter controls.[/p]
        [p]``This station will be out of commission for a long time,'' says 2-Tor. ``Slee from Zard is in for a big surprise.''[/p]
        [p]So are you. The blast brings more Zardian cyborgs. They surround the building and fire a barrage of energy-bolts at you. Your shields flare as the heavy fire begins to overwhelm them.[/p]
        [p]``You've got to do something!'' Calix yells.[/p]
        [p]``Just wait.'' You look at the sky. Starfighters swoop down, blasting the cyborgs.[/p]
        [p]``A [em]Nebula[/em] Attack Team. When they finish with the troops, they'll take Slee into custody.'' You laugh. ``I bet he didn't count on that when he made his plans.''[/p]
        [p]2-Tor's yellow lights flash. ``What he didn't count on was meeting you, boss.''[/p]

        [p]The room suddenly fills with blinding light.[/p]
        [p]``Everybody's gone but us slave-catchers,'' someone cackles. ``Slee will pay us a pretty googol for such a fine bunch.''[/p]
        [p]``What's going on?'' you ask desperately.[/p]
        [p]``They're going to sell us as slaves,'' Bishra says. ``I'm afraid we're heading for the mines.''[/p]
        [p]``But I'm a [em]Nebula[/em] operative,'' you say. ``I'm no miner.''[/p]
        [p]``Don't worry,'' laughs the slave-catcher. ``You won't be a miner for long - no one survives more than a week.''[/p]

        [p]``Fight fair,'' says the woman. ``No pulsers are permitted. If you want to reach Andron-Poc, you'll first have to defeat me. Choose your weapon: laser sword or energy-net?''[/p]

        [p]You pick up the Cube in your claws and wing back through the energy field. 2-Tor doesn't recognize you in your new shape, but luckily, he sees the Cube. That gives the robot a hint that you and the winged creature are connected. Then he makes a detailed scan of his language banks till he turns up one you both can speak.[/p]
        [p]Together you race out of the Forbidden City. The waiting mutants are overjoyed. They take the Cube and use its knowledge to turn you back to your former self. ``We're grateful to you for the Crystal Cube,'' they say.[/p]
        [p]``And I'm grateful for the knowledge in the Cube.'' Even as you speak, your wings wither away to be replaced by your familiar arms.[/p]
        [p]In a brief ceremony the mutants make you and 2-Tor heroes of their new republic.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor manages a subspace link with [em]Nebula[/em] control. You're heroes there, too.[/p]
        [p]``Thought we'd lost you!'' Captain Polaris says. ``I sent you some backup. They saved the Graviton, but couldn't find any trace of you. Sit tight. We're organizing the rescue party right now.''[/p]

        [p]A week passes. Nearly one hundred troops assemble in the programming compound to try out their new battle suits. As soon as the suits are on, you give them the signal to attack. They turn on the surprised guards, overpowering them.[/p]
        [p]Then you send your controlled cyborgs outside the compound. They march forward to destroy Slee's battle suit factory. The Zardian defense forces run.[/p]
        [p]When that battle is over, you contact the [em]Nebula[/em] for reinforcements. Meanwhile your troops are busy deploying the orbital defense control bases.[/p]
        [p]By the time [em]Nebula[/em] Attack Teams arrive Zard is defenseless. And Slee is a prisoner in his palace. All it cost you was four sleepless days and nights, controlling your cyborgs.[/p]
        [p]You look forward to a rest, but Captain Polaris has other ideas. ``We want you back on duty as soon as possible,'' he says.[/p]
        [p]``I guess we won't be getting much of a break,'' you say to 2-Tor.[/p]
        [p]He gives a happy whistle. ``I wonder what kind of adventure Polaris has waiting for us next, boss.''[/p]

        [p]The only thing you want to do on Zard is destroy Slee's factory. Unfortunately that's not a job currently being offered. ``We'll choose the chip room, whatever that is,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]The cyborg guard leads you into a small room. He points a strange-looking gun at you.[/p]
        [p]``We're making micro-microchips here,'' he says. ``So we need micro workers. Prepare to be shrunk!''[/p]
        [p]Before you can say a word, the cyborg sprays you and 2-Tor with the gun. You begin to shrink away like a balloon with a slow leak.[/p]

        [p]You turn to 2-Tor. ``We got in slick as a Vegan prat-beast,'' you whisper.[/p]

        [p]But Scarp is not meekly sitting by. He's firing, too. His huge quark cannons are locked on your little ship.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor's lights flash red. ``There's no way we can slip through this kind of firepower!'' The ship's energy shields flare.[/p]

        [p]A panel at the rear of the room slides open. Cypor Scarp walks in. He's hardly the frightening creature you were expecting. In fact, he's only three feet tall. The only upsetting thing about him is his head. It's egg-shaped, and half of it is nothing but scar tissue. Somewhere in his career he met an unfriendly laser beam.[/p]
        [p]``I'll take the Graviton now,'' he says. ``Bring it to me.''[/p]
        [p]You grip the Graviton tightly. Suddenly you're taught that size isn't everything. A beam of purple light, nearly ultraviolet, flashes from Scarp's eye. The light somehow snatches the Graviton right into Scarp's arms.[/p]
        [p]``Mice trick, eh?'' Scarp removes the patch from his other eyes. ``Now feel the wrath of my eyes displacer.''[/p]

        [p]``Tor, let's get out of here.'' You must jump to regain your balance as the ground shifts under your feet. ``Warp us home.''[/p]
        [p]Your robot friend clicks and buzzes for a few moments. ``Sorry, boss, I have no idea where you are. This planet isn't in my sector circuits.''[/p]
        [p]You stare at the ruined countryside. ``How can we ever survive in a place like this?''[/p]
        [p]You can't. Moments later the charred earth opens up. Screaming, you fall into the jaws of an underground monster. It had been waiting for someone to drop by. Unhappily, you and 2-Tor obliged.[/p]

        [p]``Slee from Zard?'' says the cyborg.[/p]
        [p]``That's right, crater brain, Slee from Zard,'' you say. ``Out of our way.''[/p]
        [p]You enter the room. Then you realize that you are the dummy. Inside sits a scaly, green-faced creature - Slee from Zard.[/p]
        [p]``Seize them, master!'' Calix Dune cries. ``They're [em]Nebula [/em] spies.''[/p]
        [p]``Oh, no!'' says 2-Tor. His red lights are going full-blast.[/p]
        [p]Two cyborgs seize you by the arms. ``Throw those two in with the kronium,'' says Slee. ``We'll warp them to Zard. They'll help us build the battle suits.''[/p]

        [p]You and 2-Tor learn quickly. Soon you're assembling tiny circuit boards all by yourselves. But all the circuits you work on don't go to Slee's battle suits.[/p]
        [p]2-Tor once worked in the Quantum Maximizer Plant on the [em]Nebula[/em]. During the next three weeks he builds a booster. Now you can tap into [em]Nebula[/em]'s deep-space communications net.[/p]
        [p]You let [em]Nebula[/em] know the coordinates of Slee's factory. Then you give your microscopic location.[/p]

        [p]Captured cyborgs restored you and 2-Tor to your natural sizes. ``You may have been small, but you did a big job,'' says the Attack Team commander. ``I'm sure you'll get quite a welcome back at the [em]Nebula[/em]. Congratulations from all of us.''[/p]

        [p]Inside, you can't believe your eyes. An eight-foot creature with bristling neon hair struggles with a terrified human in a white lab coat. The creature's toothy jaw juts out as it strangles the man. They're both bent over a portable teleporter device.[/p]

        [p]The laser-sword flares to life in your hand. You realize you've made a bad choice of weapons. This is the first time you've even held a weapon like this. And now you have to defend yourself with it.[/p]
        [p]``No,'' you whisper. ``I don't think I can defeat you.''[/p]

        [p]The last thing you recall is 2-Tor beeping frantically. The neon creature laughs hideously as blackness drops over you like a heavy curtain.[/p]
        [p]You come to and find a face looking down at you. Captain Polaris' face. ``You're lucky 2-Tor managed to get a distress call out. I sent Attack Teams immediately.''[/p]
        [p]Polaris smiles. ``We caught the [em]Darkstar[/em] with only half her crew aboard. The rest were looting the space station. They surrendered without a fight So we saved the Graviton and caught Cypor Scarp.''[/p]

        [p]``Hey, Tor.'' You look over at the robot. ``Where are we?''[/p]
        [p]``In the custody of Slee from Zard.'' The answer comes from outside the cell. ``I'd like to know the details of your mission here.''[/p]
        [p]Slee from Zard! The very name sends a shudder through you. Slee rules a slave planet on the fringes of the galaxy. Lately he's attacked and looted planets in this sector. Nearly a dozen worlds have felt his wrath. He has no idea of mercy. If he rules Mindor, you're in deep trouble.[/p]
        [p]A powerful, invisible force suddenly squeezes your head. You fear your skull may explode.[/p]

        [p]It's your turn to produce a surprise. You've kept a few steps behind 2-Tor. Now you leap into the room to show the cyborgs how zero-g unarmed combat works.

        [p]Before you is a massive spike-encrusted ball, bearing the image of an eclipsed sun. You fire your thrusters to avoid smashing into the huge ship. Then you realize the spike ball is the dreaded [em]Darkstar[/em]. This is the battle cruiser commanded by Cypor Scarp.[/p]
