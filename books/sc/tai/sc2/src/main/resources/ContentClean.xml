    <text>{\fi0\qc Welcome aboard!\par}\par The year is 2525 A.D., an age when mankind is moving out among the stars.\par You've just come aboard the space station \i Nebula\i0 , home of the peacekeeping and investigation branch of the Network of Worlds. From this manmade satellite you, as a \i Nebula\i0  operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.\par The \i Nebula\i0 's teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the \i Challenger\i0 . If you need help at any time, feel free to send to the \i Nebula\i0  for reinforcements.\par Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will depend on \i your\i0  choices. Successful \i Nebula\i0  operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.\par Hurry! Captain Polaris needs you!</text>

  <p id="2">
    <text>You move along on the teleramp that rolls through the \i Nebula\i0 . A familiar silvery beep sounds behind you.\par "Hi, boss," 2-Tor says. The robot hovers next to you. "We should get to \i Nebula \i0 Control. Captain Polaris has a mission for us."\par "I was just going there, Tor," you reply. "Come on."\par Minutes later you and 2-Tor enter \i Nebula \i0 Control. It's the brains of the space station. Beings from all over the Network of Worlds work there to keep the galaxy safe. Captain Polaris floats on his command chair in the center of Control.\par "Reporting as ordered, sir," you call. But Captain Polaris only salutes. Then he turns to the vidscreens that hover all around his chair.\par An Earthwoman approaches you. "The captain is busy right now," she says. "He's sorry he can't speak to you personally. I'll give you your assignment" You recognize her as Ensign Janus, Captain Polaris's second-in-command.\par "We have a mystery that could mean the end of the Network of Worlds," Ensign Janus continues. "Follow me to the warping bay, and I'll tell you what we know."</text>

  <p id="3">
    <text>"We're having trouble contacting the Rimworlds - the planets at the rim of the galaxy," says Ensign Janus. "Captain Polaris wants you to go there and find out what's happening."\par You and 2-Tor follow her on the ramp that leads to the warping bay. As the ramp stops moving, the portal opens and you enter the bay. "Here's your bio-support suit," Janus says. Made of meganium, the suit molds around your body when you put it on.\par "You can warp to the Rimworlds, or you can take the \i Challenger\i0  shuttlecraft," Janus continues. "Remember, 2-Tor can warp you around. But don't try going through planets or suns. If you need help, access the \i Nebula\i0 . Good luck."\par Before you can make a decision, alarms sound. 2-Tor lets off a shrill whistle and squeals, "The \i Nebula\i0  is being attacked!"</text>

  <p id="4">
    <text>Lights flash on Ensign Janus's wrist signaler. "I've got to get back to Control," she says. "All sections are being invaded. I don't know what you should do. We need you out on assignment, but this is an emergency. It's up to you."\par "This invasion does not compute," 2-Tor says. His blue lights flash, and you know he thinks you should proceed with caution. "Lifeforms can't approach the \i Nebula \i0 undetected," 2-Tor says. "The invasion does not compute."\par "These aren't lifeforms," she replies. "They're robots that look like lifeforms. We call them androids!" She runs to the transport ramp. You and 2-Tor are left alone in the warping bay.\par "Do we stay or do we go, boss?" 2-Tor bleeps. "What'll it be?"</text>

    <text>"I want a good look at those pods," you tell 2-Tor. "Maybe we can find out why the androids are growing them."\par You fly down to the planet, where you hover over one of the pods. It rises slightly, sensing that you are there. Then the pod begins to split open. Half-formed androids lie inside.\par "Get us out of here, 2-Tor," you shout. "Every one of those pods is a living android factory. There must be thousands of them on this world. We have to inform the \i Nebula\i0 ."\par Suddenly a fibrous tentacle snaps up from the open pod, wrapping itself around you and 2-Tor. "Tor!" you cry. "I need micro-pulser power!"\par "No go, boss," 2-Tor beeps. "That thing's touch shut down most of my systems. It will be a few nanoseconds before I can switch them on again."\par "We haven't got a few nanoseconds," you shout The pod pulls both of you inside it It closes, leaving you in darkness.</text>

  <p id="6">
    <text>"Let's go outside, 2-Tor," you say. "We have to talk to that kid. The alien towers miles above you. ft has the eyes of a child. With a crackling noise, it swats at you as if you were an insect.\par "We've got to communicate with Big Eyes," you tell 2-Tor. "The crackling may be a language. Try to translate it."\par Nanoseconds later 2-Tor's lights flash green. 'You're patched in, boss. Talk away."\par "\i Stop playing with your toys!\i0 " you say. The big eyes open wide. "\i You are wreaking havoc on another world! You must stop!\i0 "\par "OK!" Big Eyes screams. It begins to cry. You have given it the scare of its life.\par "\i Play one more game before you put away these toys. Fly all your shuttlecraft out of the black hole and back to the\i0  Nebula." You hustle back to the \i Challenger\i0  as Big Eyes obeys. Soon you are on your way back.</text>
    <next id="7"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="7">
    <text>"Do you think Big Eyes was a child?" 2-Tor asks.\par "Yes," you reply. "Whatever game it was playing with its toys became real somehow. It put toy androids in a toy \i Nebula\i0 , and real androids appeared in the real \i Nebula\i0 . If it happens again, we'll know where to look. Only one thing bothers me."\par "What's that, boss?"\par "If that's the size of the child, how big are the \i parents\i0 ?"</text>

  <p id="8">
    <text>"An SOS is an SOS!" you sigh. "We have to answer it." But when you go up to the android and touch it, you are shocked.\par Its skin is warm. It can't be an android. "Beware..." it gasps. "Go away... before this happens to you..."\par "What do you mean?" you ask. "W-what are you? Why do you and the others look alike?"\par "We... are clones..." the alien replies. "Seeded." Its eyes open wide and stare at you. It's clear the creature doesn't have long to live. "Star sector H-1212/M. You'll find your answers there."\par With a pop, the alien vanishes.\par "Wow!" 2-Tor says. "What do you think of that?" His blue lights flash caution.\par "I don't know," you reply. "That was spooky. Can you warp us to sector H-1212/M from here?"\par "Is a Vegan wobat kweebo?" 2-Tor says. You feel the familiar tingle of warp circuits cutting in.\par In milliseconds you and 2-Tor materialize above a purple planet. Liquid swirls in torrents on its surface.\par "This is the only inhabitable world in the system," 2-Tor bleeps. "There's one rocky island here, and the rest is liquid. Watch out, boss. The liquid dissolves almost all molecules into quarks."</text>
    <next id="9"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="9">
    <text>"Swell. Let's try the island." You see androids below, herding aliens into a small clearing. "Tor! Those aliens are from the Rimworlds. What are they doing here?"\par "We're going to find out." 2-Tor clicks. "Look!"\par A plastisteel ball rises above the crowd. It breaks open at the seams, showering dark dust onto the captive aliens. "Scan the dust, 2-Tor. What is it?"\par "Living cells," the robot replies.\par You gasp in fear. The dust strikes an alien and turns it into an android clone. "That's where the fake androids came from. Call for a \i Nebula\i0  attack squad."\par "Um... boss..." 2-Tor says, as his red signals flash. "It's too late." A group of androids has seen you. And they have weapons.</text>

    <text>"Security can handle the invasion," you tell 2-Tor. "Let's follow orders, and warp to the Rimworlds."\par Nanoseconds later you materialize in space. The Rimworlds are only a half-parsec away, and you are stunned by what you see. "The Rimworlds are gone!" Only a gigantic ring of rock chunks remains where they used to be. "It's just like the ring around Saturn!"\par "Guess again, boss. That ring is the Rimworlds! Something has changed them." Suddenly 2-Tor's red danger signals pulse. "Incoming warpers!"\par In seconds you are surrounded. "\i Look!\i0 " you thoughtcast to 2-Tor. "\i They might be men, but they all have the same face! They're androids!\i0 "\par "Surrender," an android says. "You will be our slave."\par "\i Looks like they want you,\i0 " 2-Tor says. "\i Thoughtcast the word and we'll blast them.\i0 "\par "\i I'm not sure,\i0 " you say. "\i They must know what's going on. Surrendering to them might be a good way to find out.\i0 "\par "Surrender, human," another android says. "Or die."</text>

  <p id="11">
    <text>"No time to fix my warper, 2-Tor," you say. "We're blasting off this planet!"\par 2-Tor beeps and whistles as pulserblasts graze him. "Your wish is my command!" The two of you pulse into space as the army of androids arcs up to follow you.\par "We're in trouble, boss," 2-Tor says. "The androids are catching up. We'll never get away from them."\par "Head to the nearest star, 2-Tor!" you say. "I've got an idea."\par "It had better work," the robot replies. "We won't get another chance. The androids are right on our neutron exhaust trail."\par "Up shields," you tell 2-Tor. Suddenly you veer toward a bright green star. Its cosmic rays lick your suit, and your little friend's warning lights flash red. "We're going in!"\par "Into the star?" 2-Tor bleeps. "We can't survive in there! We're doomed!"</text>
    <next id="30"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="12">
    <text>"Hyperdrive systems on!" you tell 2-Tor. Negatron missiles close in on the \i Challenger\i0 . "Let's lead them on a merry chase!"\par The \i Challenger \i0 roars into action, speeding across the alien world. But the missiles have locked onto the shuttle, and are following it. Desperately you fly the craft in a spiral. The missiles swerve in pursuit.\par Around and around you go. You begin to worry as your spiral narrows. If the missiles don't hit each other before they hit the \i Challenger\i0 , you will be destroyed.\par Suddenly two missiles collide. The explosions trigger the nearby third missile. The Challenger has survived. 2-Tor's lights flash yellow, but they suddenly turn red.\par The force of the blast has sent the shuttlecraft into a spin. You whirl helplessly toward the alien planet. But as you hit the planet's atmosphere, the ship glides out of its spin. It touches ground and slides for hundreds of miles. At long last it stops.</text>
    <next id="13"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="13">
    <text>"I don't believe it," you say. "We're still in one piece."\par Then a giant hand picks up the \i Challenger\i0  as if it were a toy. Your vidscreen picks up an image from the ground below.\par A huge box is filled with shuttlecraft, androids, negatron missiles. "The \i Nebula\i0  is in there, too," you cry.\par "Negative!" 2-Tor says. "They're toys. Replicas."\par The giant hand pulls a shuttlecraft from the toy \i Nebula\i0 . The hand belongs to an alien child. It's playing with toys. Somehow the toys are affecting the real things.</text>

  <p id="14">
    <text>"The alien is right!" you tell 2-Tor. Tears of joy roll down the thick folds of the alien's cheeks as you aim your micro-pulser at him.\par "Thank you," it howls. "1 should have died dozens of cycles ago."\par But before you can fire, the computer takes action against you. Electrodes lash from the circuitboards. They tear through your bio-support suit. Liquid plastisteel slaps against you, making it impossible to move. Highly charged wires imbed themselves in you. Your brain is connected to the computer circuits.\par The computer has won. You are now like the alien inventor - a prisoner of the supercomputer.\par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

  <p id="15">
    <text>   You wake painfully, realizing you must have blacked out in the warpgate. You're amazed to find hordes of aliens shambling around you. Then you see 2-Tor, floating in a stasis field above you. Your bio-support suit floats next to him. "Hey, chrome-dome," you say. "I don't think this is the \i Nebula\i0 ."\par The android leader suddenly appears in hologram form. "Only machines can pass through my warpgate," it says. "Living beings automatically come here, where you will spend the rest of your life. I think I'll leave your robot and suit floating out of reach until you lose all hope."\par "Where am I?" you ask.\par The android sneers. "In my slave pens," it says. 2-Tor hoots unhappily.</text>
    <next id="57"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="16">
    <text>"We've got to learn what's controlling the androids," you tell 2-Tor as you stare through the hole. The view on the other side looks sinister. "We have to enter the other dimension."\par You leap through the gate.\par "Fools," a voice says. "You should not have come here."\par "It's Gigantus," you gasp. But the face that growls at you belongs to an even larger creature.\par "I'm his wife," the monster growls. "You shouldn't beat up my husband. I'll deal with you." A huge paw waves over you.\par You start to apologize, but your voice is gone. Your body is disappearing, too. You can already see through your hand, and all that's left of 2-Tor is a tiny red light. It blinks on and off. At last it fades away.\par With your last sight, you can see the Gigantus's wife yelling at him and pulling him home by the ear. You'd laugh if you had anything left to laugh with. Then you blink out, too.\par{\par\fi0\qc\b ZAP!\par}</text>

  <p id="17">
    <text>"We're stuck," you say as the androids move in for the kill. "Can you override the portal controls, 2-Tor?"\par A cable swings from 2-Tor and attaches to the portal switch. The instant it connects a mechanical voice says, "Remain calm. A security force is on its way. Do not move. Do not open portal. Thank you."\par The androids stop. Their weapons are aimed at you, and the portal. "That's it," you whisper to 2-Tor. "Those androids don't want to kill us. They want to ambush the security team. Then they can get into the main part of the \i Nebula\i0 . We have to stop them."\par "Warning the security force is possible," 2-Tor says. "But improbable. All sections of the \i Nebula\i0  are equipped with detonators that will blow the androids Into space if they threaten the ship."\par Through the portal, you can hear the security team. You have to act quickly.</text>

    <text>"We have to go through the gas," you tell 2-Tor. "It's the only way to a noninfected area. Our shields should give us some protection."\par You see nothing but orange all around you. It stings your skin and tastes bitter on your tongue. "2-Tor?" you ask. "Should I be able to taste or feel the gas with shields on? Tor? Are you there?"\par A weak silvery voice reaches you. "My circuits are dissolving, boss," 2-Tor beeps weakly. "Go on without me."\par "Can we warp out of here?"\par "Improbable. My warp circuits are damaged. Leave me here. You have only a few feet left to go."\par 2-Tor is right. Ahead, you can see the corridor exit lock But 2-Tor will not survive the gas attack without you.</text>

Your section floats through space, away from the \i Nebula\i0 .\par The androids aren't doing any better. Many were crushed in the blastoff. The rest are pressed to the walls.\par All at once you float away from the ceiling. You are in zero-gravity now, and in deadly danger.\par "Look out, boss!" 2-Tor beeps, but it's too late. The androids grab you, and you can't break free of them.</text>

  <p id="21">
    <text>"Run, Tor. Or we won't live long enough to find out how androids got aboard the \i Nebula\i0 ," you say. You sprint down the corridor.\par "I can't keep up," 2-Tor cries. "Go on without me!"\par "There's one chance," you say, as you approach a familiar door. "Let's hide in the shuttle bay!" You leap through the portal and hit the portal controls. It twists shut. As you listen, the androids clank by. Soon they are far past you.\par "We lost them," you say. 2-Tor beeps a beep of relief. But you are startled by the roar of an engine.

But as he accesses the \i Challenger\i0 's controls, you hear a highpitched whine.\par "You have interrupted launch procedure," a computer voice says. "This is not permitted.

When it fades, you are above the \i Nebula\i0 .\par "OK, warp us back in," you say. But your little friend's red signals flash weakly.\par "Our power is gone, boss," he clicks. "Looks like this is the end." You can feel your bio-support system beginning to fail.\par "I scan an incoming energy burst," 2-Tor gasps. "It's coming from the \i Nebula\i0 ." Suddenly you're in \i Nebula \i0 Control. Captain Polaris reaches out his hand to welcome you. Then you see Lieutenant Gark, struggling to break out of an ionic field that holds him captive.\par "We caught Gark before he did any damage," the captain explains.

You wonder how long it takes for androids to get suspicious.\par "Report to Captain Polaris!" the android chief repeats. A glowing portal lies ahead of you. Bright signs flash Danger! No Entry!\par The android stops you. "We should not go in," he says. You shake your head.\par "This is the secret entrance to \i Nebula\i0  Control," you say.\par "\i Boss!\i0 " 2-Tor gasps.

You rip through the stem, tearing its stony roots from the ground. The howls of the other Sarn roar in your ears. You try to shut out the sound. It does no good.\par Finally you fall free from the pod. It shrivels to a husk. But the other Sarn turn their thoughts to you. "\i You are doomed, human,\i0 " a Sarn says in your head. "\i Our juice has already changed you.\i0 "\par Against your will your arm begins to rise. It has become an android arm and it is following the orders of the Sarn.

They have reprogrammed to ward off magnetic interference, and they're aiming gravity charges at you.\par "Destroy," the androids say together.\par "Uh-oh!" you say.\par "Five seconds, boss," 2-Tor bleeps.

    <text>"Don't give up!" You comfort the alien inventor. "Maybe I can free you!"\par "No!" the alien shrieks. "Destroy me!"\par "Set micro-phasers to the max, 2-Tor," you order. A needle of light shoots from your micro-phaser and strikes a wire. The computer screams!\par "Did you pick up \i that \i0 input?" 2-Tor whirs.\par The androids tear away from the computer and stalk toward you. The inventor is half-free, but the computer isn't giving up.\par "Boss!" 2-Tor cries. His red warning lights flash. The androids grab him. In milliseconds they will get you, too.\par "Sorry about this," you tell the inventor. You wrench him free from the computer, and explosions rock the whole complex. The inventor's brain was the machine's database, and you have stolen it The androids drop like stones as the computer fizzles out.\par With 2-Tor and the alien, you flee into space. The superplanet shudders as if it is going to blow up. Then all is quiet "The Network of Worlds can settle people here now," you tell 2-Tor. "When the computer stopped, it was the end of the android invasion."</text>

    <text>"Did you see that?" you exclaim. "Where is that shuttle going? And how?"\par "Insufficient data," 2-Tor replies. "My computer can't answer that question. Perhaps the \i Challenger \i0 would be of use?"\par "Of course!" You look at the sleek shuttlecraft in the next dock. "The \i Challenger\i0 's computers can track the other shuttle." You both scramble onto the shuttlecraft\par As soon as you enter, the hatch clicks shut The ship's hyperdrive engines start up. "Oh, no!" you say. "The \i Challenger \i0 is taking off, too!"</text>

    <text>"2-Tor," you say. "They're androids. When you get my signal, take off."\par "We must report to Captain Polaris," the security head repeats. "Lead us."\par "Sure," you say. You get in front of them. "\i Now!\i0 " you shout, and you and 2-Tor zoom down the corridor. The androids try to blast you, but you've gotten out of range.\par "They'll follow us, 2-Tor," you say. "What's up ahead?"\par "\i Challenger \i0 bay is on this level," 2-Tor beeps.\par Seconds later you leap into the bay. It seals itself behind you. You slide breathlessly to the floor and sit there.\par A shadow looms over you. "Uh-oh, boss," 2-Tor says. "I think we're in trouble."\par A ten-foot-tall android stands over you. Each of its fingers are micro-pulsers.</text>

    <text>You fire at the clones with a low-power pulserblast. "Boss!" 2-Tor bleeps. "What are you doing? That blast wouldn't even stop me!"\par "Up shields, Tor!" The clones open fire. "We need more power, and we'll get it from the clones. Deflect their blasts to the purple sea. Add all our power to the blast!"\par "I get it," 2-Tor says. The energy glances off your shields. "We hit the liquid at the right angle, with the right amount of power..."\par The sea ripples under the force of your beam. It bubbles and throbs for a moment Then it gushes over the island in a giant wave. When the wave backs away the clones and androids are gone. Only the island remains.\par "That clonedust had to be completely destroyed," you say. "It could have infected the whole galaxy."\par "It won't now," 2-Tor says. Happy yellow lights flash on his chestplate. "Thanks to us."</text>

"Anything is better than sitting out there."\par The only light in the crevice comes from the red warning lights on 2-Tor's chestplate. "1 hope you're right, boss." He follows you into the cold gash in the rock. For long seconds you feel your way along the walls. The path is narrowing, but you can't turn back. Groot is somewhere behind you.\par Then the walls of the crevice come together ahead of you.
