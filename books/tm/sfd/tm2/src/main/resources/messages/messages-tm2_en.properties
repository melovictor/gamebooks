For 140 million years these fantastic creatures walked the Earth.\nWhen the earliest dinosaurs appeared, the continents were linked together. This was the Triassic Period. Over the two time periods that followed, the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, the continents broke apart and slowly formed the shapes we are familiar with today.\nOver 340 different types of dinosaurs traveled across these changing continents. Some were big, some were small, and some were not much bigger than birds. These smaller dinosaurs included the coelurosaurs, from which the target of your mission, the archaeopteryx, evolved. Like coelurosaurs, archaeopteryx ate insects and made its home in the forest. Unlike coelurosaurs, its body was covered with feathers!\nOn the following pages, you will be told about some of the most important dinosaurs of the three periods of the Mesozoic Era, when all dinosaurs lived. Study these pictures carefully; they will tell you which dinosaurs lived in which period, and also about the terrain.\nIt is important to remember that for prehistoric times, 140 million years ago is further back in time than 63 million years ago. You can check the timeline for more examples.\n\nMillion years B.C.\n570+\nPre-Cambrian  Early life on Earth\n500+\nCambrian\n430+\nOrdovician\n395+\nSilurian   First land plants\n345+\nDevonian   First amphibians\n280+\nPermian Modern insects appear\n225+\nTriassic   First Dinosaurs First mammals\n195+\nJurassic   Middle dinosaur\n135+\nCretaceous   First flowering plants Last dinosaur\n65+\nTertiary Hoofed mammals and apes appear\n2+\nQuaternary  Age of man\n\nThe Triassic Period (225–195 million B.C.)\nA Kuehnosaurus – a gliding reptile (not a dinosaur)\nB Dimetrodon – a tall-spined reptile (not a dinosaur)\nC Plateosaur – one of the first plant-eating dinosaurs\nD Thrinaxodon\nE Cynognathus – furry, mammallike reptiles, ancestors of dinosaurs and mammals\n\nThe Jurassic Period (195–135 million B.C.)\nA Camarasaur – a plant-eating dinosaur from the sauropod (lizard-hipped) family\nB Diplodocus – one of the longest dinosaurs, also a sauropod\nC Stegosaur – a plant-eating dinosaur with plates on its back\nD Allosaur – a huge-jawed meateater\nE Coelurosaur – a speedy insect- and meat-eating dinosaur\n\nThe Jurassic Period (continued)\nA Pterosaur – a flying reptile, not a dinosaur and not a close relative of archaeopteryx\nB Plesiosaur – sea-dwelling creatures related to the dinosaurs\nC Ichthyosaur – sea-dwelling creatures related to the dinosaurs\nD Dragonfly – larger than the modern-day dragonfly, very common throughout the Mesozoic Era\n\nThe Cretaceous Period (135–63 million B.C.)\nA Pachycephalosaur – a dome-skull dinosaur\nB Brachylophosaur – a duck-billed, plant-eating dinosaur of the hadrosaur family\nC Tyrannosaurus – a 39-foot-high meat-eating dinosaur\nD Flowering bushes – these plants first appeared in this period\n\nThe Cretaceous Period (continued)\nA Pterandon – a flying reptile, not a dinosaur\nB Triceratops – plant-eating horned dinosaur\nC Ankylosaur – A plant-eating armored dinosaur with a club tail\nD Deinonychus – a meat-eating dinosaur with claws on its fingers and toes\nE Flowering bushes – these plants first appeared in this period\n\nFor the first part of your mission, you must figure out in what time period archaeopteryx lived: the Triassic, the Jurassic, or the Cretaceous.\nFor the second part of your mission you must figure out where in that time period archaeoptryx lived. Then you must find it and take its photograph.\nBe careful. As you are about to see, the Age of Dinosaurs was filled with plant-eating giants such as brontosaurus, meat-eating giants such as tyrannosaurus and some of the most amazing creatures ever to walk the Earth.
