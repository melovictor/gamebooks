        [p]Welcome to the Carnival of Horrors. This is no ordinary carnival. Here you'll find awesome rides. Exciting games of chance. And the weirdest Freak Show ever.[/p]
        [p]Do you dare to enter?[/p]
        [p]Are you brave enough to risk the Supersonic Space Coaster? Can you make it through the House of Horrors alive?[/p]
        [p]This scary adventure is all about [em]you.[/em] You decide what will happen. And you decide how terrifying the scares will be.[/p]

        [p]“What do [em]you[/em] want to do?”[/p]
        [p]“I don't know, Patty. What do [em]you[/em] want to do?”[/p]
        [p]“Not fair, Brad. I asked you first.”[/p]
        [p]Patty and Brad. Your two best friends. Arguing. As usual.[/p]
        [p]It's the last week of August. And Patty and Brad haven't stopped fighting since your summer vacation started.[/p]
        [p]Patty likes being bossy. You don't mind, though. It's no big deal.[/p]
        [p]It's hard to win a fight with her anyway. You don't know why Brad even tries. You guess it's because he doesn't want to look like a wimp in front of a girl.[/p]
        [p]“There's nothing to do. I guess I'll just go home,” Brad says. He shoves his hands in his pockets. Then his shoulders slump and he sort of shrivels up. You guess Brad is kind of a wimp – even if he is your best friend.[/p]
        [p]“You're so boring, Brad,” Patty complains. Whenever Patty complains, her freckles really pop out. Now there are about a million of them spread across her face.[/p]
        [p]“Hey! I know what we should do!” Patty suddenly bursts out.[/p]

        [p]“Let's bike over to Bennet's Field and watch them set up the carnival!"[/p]
        [p]“I don't know," you answer. “It's getting dark and Mom said I have to be in by nine."[/p]
        [p]“It's only a quick bike ride," Brad says. “Are you some kind of wimp?"[/p]
        [p]Brad calling you a wimp? You can't believe it![/p]
        [p]“Okay. Okay," you agree. “But if it's as bad as last year, there won't be much to see. Don't you remember the main attraction?” you remind them. “The ride they called Terror Track? It turned out to be a baby choo-choo train that circled around and around and around."[/p]
        [p]It doesn't matter what you say. Patty's made up her mind. You're going to ride over to the carnival.[/p]
        [p]A hot, humid breeze blows in your face as you pedal along. Patty's in the lead. No surprise. And Brad's puffing behind you.[/p]
        [p]It's dark by the time you reach Bennet's Field.[/p]
        [p]You and your friends drop your bikes in the grass and race across the moonlit field, toward the huge wooden fence that surrounds the carnival.[/p]
    </text>

  <p id="3">
    <text>
        [p]As you reach the carnival entrance, you hear music coming from inside. Not the usual corny organ stuff they always play. But some really strange music. It sounds familiar and totally new at the same time.[/p]
        [p]Brad stretches his neck to try to peer over the fence. But no luck. The fence is way too high.[/p]
        [p]Patty jiggles the padlock on the door. It's sealed shut.[/p]
        [p]“I guess we'll have to wait until tomorrow night when the carnival opens,” Brad says.[/p]
        [p]“No way,” Patty says. “Let's climb the fence. Now!”[/p]
        [p]“Are you crazy?” Brad says. “We'll get caught!”[/p]
        [p]“Come on. There's probably no one in there,” Patty replies.[/p]
        [p]Your friends turn to you to cast the deciding vote. You glance at your watch. It's almost 9:00 P.M. If you're going to get home in time, you should start back now.[/p]
        [p]What are you going to do?[/p]

        [p]“Wh-what do you mean?” Brad asks, trembling all over.[/p]
        [p]“I just had an idea. A great idea,” the man replies. "I want you kids to stay and try out the rides before the grand opening tomorrow.”[/p]
        [p]Patty's eyes open wide. “Cool!” she says.[/p]
        [p]“Are you sure it's all right with the owner?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“I'm Big Al, the manager. And what I say around here goes.”[/p]
        [p]Big Al digs around in his checkered jacket and pulls out three maps. He hands one to each of you.[/p]
        [p]“Study them carefully,” he says. “If you have any questions, ask them now.”[/p]
        [p]Your eyes fall upon the map. You have a question. But when you gaze up, Big Al is gone. He's vanished![/p]
        [p]“A whole carnival to ourselves!” Patty exclaims. “Where should we start?”[/p]
        [p]You stare down at your map once again. You notice that the carnival is split in half. On one side are the rides. Tons of them. On the other side is the midway, packed with games of chance and the Freak Show.[/p]
        [p]What will you try first?[/p]

    <text>
        [p]“Come on, run!” you yell to Patty and Brad as you spin around. “There's got to be another way out!”[/p]
        [p]Big Al blow's a whistle. Its shrill blast hurts your ears. He blow's it again and, suddenly, dozens and dozens of carnival people appear out of nowhere. But they don't look the way they did before.[/p]
        [p]Some have green flesh. Some are deathly white. Their rotting skin hangs from their bones. Above their sunken cheekbones, their eyes glow an eerie yellow.[/p]
        [p]You w'atch in horror as more and more of them appear.[/p]
        [p]What should you do? Your legs won't budge. You can't think clearly. You're terrified! You stand there – frozen – in a trance.[/p]
        [p]But Brad breaks the spell when he screams out, “They're ghosts! That's why they're wearing those old-fashioned clothes. They're dead!”[/p]
        [p]“Watch out! Over there!” Patty yells. “That – that ghost … it's coming right at us. Run!”[/p]

  <p id="6">
    <text>
        [p]“Let's do it!” you say to your friends. “Let's climb the fence!”[/p]
        [p]Patty is halfway up before you finish speaking. You let Brad go next. You're last.[/p]
        [p]It's a hard climb up. There's really no place on the fence to get a good grip. But you make it to the top, swing your legs over, and tumble down. You land on the grass. You're inside![/p]
        [p]You and your friends gaze around. It's pretty dark – the only light comes from torches. At first the carnival looks the same as it always does. Dinky rides. Hot dog wagons. Then the lights stall to flicker on in every corner of the field – the rides start to move. It's as if the whole place is magically coming to life.[/p]
        [p]“Hey! Look at that giant roller coaster!” you exclaim, pointing up ahead. “They never had a roller coaster before!”[/p]
        [p]“Yeah,” Brad agrees. “And the whole place is a lot bigger than last year!”[/p]
        [p]“This is awesome!” Patty says as she sprints toward the rides.[/p]
    </text>
    <next id="7"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="7">
    <text>
        [p]You and Brad take off after Patty. You all stop in front of the roller coaster.[/p]
        [p]“Wow!” Patty says as she gazes up at it. “It's like a rocket to outer space!”[/p]
        [p]Beyond the roller coaster, you spy a castle surrounded by a moat. And a spooky-looking haunted house sitting high atop a hill.[/p]
        [p]“These are the coolest rides I've ever seen!” you say. “They still have that dumb choo-choo train over there,” you point out, “but we could ride this stuff all night and never go near it!”[/p]
        [p]Patty grabs your arm and tugs you over to the other side of the carnival – to the midway. Brad races after you.[/p]
        [p]“Hey! Where are all those dinky wooden booths from last year?” you ask as you gawk at the amazing games of chance.[/p]
        [p]They're gone. And in their place are giant video games and huge spinning wheels studded with hundreds of blinking colored lights![/p]
        [p]“Get a load of that!” Brad suddenly cries out.[/p]
        [p]You and Patty spin around.[/p]
        [p]You can't believe what you see![/p]
    </text>
    <next id="87">Be more amazed</next>
  </p>
  <p id="8">
    <text>
        [p]You wander over to the Wheel of Chance and immediately notice two strange things.[/p]
        [p]First, you read the sign on the booth. It says Wheel of No Chance. Then you hear the barker's voice calling, “Step right up!” But there's no one there.[/p]
        [p]No one but a green-and-yellow parrot.[/p]
        [p]“Excuse me,” you say, hoping someone will answer. “Is this game open?”[/p]
        [p]“No, I'm standing by this wheel for my health,” the parrot cracks. “Now do you want to spin or what?”[/p]
        [p]The parrot is obviously annoyed. “Mammals,” he mutters. “Can't live with them, can't live without them.”[/p]
        [p]You steal a glance around. Maybe you should skip this game. But Big Al sneaks up behind you.[/p]
        [p]“Spin,” he says. “You must earn enough points to win.”[/p]
        [p]“But how will I know if I have enough points?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“[em]Spin![/em]” It's his final word.[/p]

        [p]You've decided to help the freaks. As you race down the midway, you spot Brad and Patty.[/p]
        [p]“Listen, guys,” you tell them, lowering your voice. “We've got a problem. A big problem.”[/p]
        [p]You take a deep breath and tell them all about Madame Zeno and the blue card.[/p]
        [p]“So,” you finish saying, “somebody might need our help in the back of the Freak Show.”[/p]
        [p]“What's a freak?” Brad asks nervously.[/p]
        [p]“Remember the poster we saw when we came in? The one with the three-headed man and the lady with the snake body?” you remind him.[/p]
        [p]Brad bites down on his lip. “Are they really real?”[/p]
        [p]“Sure they're real,” Patty chimes in. “I once sawr a bearded lady at the circus.”[/p]
        [p]“I don't know,” Brad says. “It sounds kind of creepy.”[/p]
        [p]“Well, Madame Zeno said this wras my fate. I'm going to help them – whatever they are. Are you guys in?”[/p]
        [p]“You bet,” Patty answers, her eyes shining with excitement.[/p]
        [p]“Okay, okay. I'll go,” Brad mumbles.[/p]
        [p]“Then let's hurry!” you exclaim.[/p]

        [p]You run to the right. "‘Follow me!” you cry out to Patty and Brad.[/p]
        [p]You run faster than you've ever run in your life. Your sides ache, but you keep on going.[/p]
        [p]When your chest feels as if it's about to burst, you finally stop. And hear a crash behind you. Then at both sides of you. Then in front of you. Trapping you.[/p]
        [p]“Welcome to the Reptile's Petting Zoo,” a deep voice echoes through the darkness.[/p]
        [p][em]Reptile's[/em] Petting Zoo? You thought the sign said [em]Reptile[/em] Petting Zoo.[/p]
        [p]“Our alligator has been so lonely,” the deep voice continues. “Waiting and waiting – for his new pets to arrive. And here you are – finally.”[/p]

        [p]The room is dark, but all around you, you hear hushed moans. “Help us! Help us!”[/p]
        [p]“We're in a prison,” Patty says. “And look at the prisoners! They're weird!”[/p]
        [p]Patty is right. As your eyes grow accustomed to the darkness, you see cell after cell. Each one holds a strange-looking prisoner. There's an enormous fat lady who's nearly busting out of the bars. A giant. A dwarf. A young lady with boa constrictors wrapped around her waist. And a woman with a long black beard![/p]
        [p]“We're the freakssss,” the Snake Lady says. “Every night when the show ends, the master locks us up.”[/p]
        [p]“The master? You mean Big Al is – ” you start to say.[/p]
        [p]“You must help us!” the giant interrupts.[/p]

        [p]You reach out slowly and touch the red card.[/p]
        [p]To your amazement a 3-D heart magically appeal's and rises from the flat surface. Then it starts to beat! [em]Tha-dump, tha-dump.[/em] It must be some fancy optical illusion. You lean closer to figure out the trick.[/p]
        [p]“Yowwwww!” you screech and jerk back to avoid the warm red liquid that nearly squirts in your eye. Is it blood? It looks like blood. “Wow! Cool effect,” you say. “How did you do it?”[/p]
        [p]“Turn over the card,” Madame Zeno orders. “Do it now!”[/p]
        [p]Madame Zeno really gets into her act. Doesn't she know this is just a game? you think. But you do as you're told.[/p]
        [p]Big deal. No weird pictures. No hidden fortunes. All you see are the numbers [em]1, 3, 2[/em] shimmering in gold script against a midnight background. “What does it mean?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“You will know when the time is right,” the fortune-teller whispers. Her voice is so low, you can barely hear her. “It could save your life!”[/p]

        [p]“Hi!” you say to Big Al. “Who are all those people?”[/p]
        [p]He doesn't really answer your question.[/p]
        [p]“Welcome to the Carnival of Horrors,” he says. “You [em]must[/em] play or pay. We have many games on our midway. You [em]must[/em] play two.” He practically spits the word [em]must[/em] out. “If you succeed, you can win prizes. But if you lose, you pay with your life!”[/p]
        [p]Boy, he's really laying it on thick, you think. But it's a pretty cool gimmick. “Okay, I'll play a game. Then I've got to go home.”[/p]
        [p]“No one goes home,” Big Al says, “until they play. You must play [em]two[/em] games. And survive.”[/p]
        [p]“Okay. Okay,” you mutter to yourself.[/p]

        [p]You break through the crowd and grab Big Al's arm. “Hey! Do you know where my friends are?” “Certainly,” Big Al says, pointing up ahead. “They're right over there!”[/p]

        [p]You guessed it. The silver locker was a time machine. You've gone back in time to the first moment you spotted the carnival. Now it appears as if you have to start all over again – fighting horror after horror, right up to …[/p]

        [p]You're pretty sure that the space lady guessed wrong! Now all you have to do is step on the scale to prove it.[/p]
        [p]The two goons shove you inside the planet simulation chamber. It's a long narrow tube, and it's really stuffy inside. You can barely breathe.[/p]
        [p]You step up on the scale. You check the readout. Boy, oh, boy! The space lady [em]is[/em] wrong![/p]
        [p]You jump up and down. “I won! I won!”[/p]
        [p]Back outside you collect your prize. It's a huge chocolate bar. You take a big bite out of it and stuff the rest in your pocket.[/p]
        [p]You gaze around. The coast is clear. Maybe you can find Patty and Brad and get out of here.[/p]
        [p]You walk a few steps forward. But a heavy hand clamps down on your shoulder from behind.[/p]
        [p]It's Big Al.[/p]
        [p]“It's time to play another game,” he says, grinning.[/p]

        [p]You yank on the reins. But your horse plows ahead, pulling you forward – closer and closer to the chopping, chopping, chopping blades. Brad squinches down in the cart and buries his head in his lap.[/p]
        [p]Patty jumps into the front seat with you. Together you pull on the reins and scream, "Whoa, fellow! Whoa!”[/p]
        [p]But your horse trots onward. "It's no use,” you cry. "We'd better jump!”[/p]
        [p]You stare over the side. You're riding along a narrow ridge and there's a deep drop that makes your blood run cold! If you jump, you'll plunge to your death![/p]
        [p]Then you glance up ahead – and spot a safer place to leap. Great![/p]
        [p]You are about to show it to your friends when Brad cries out, "Look at the elves! They chop at set times. If we can get the horse to move faster, we can miss the axes!”[/p]
        [p]"That's dumb, we should jump!” argues Patty.[/p]

        [p]“Are you ready for The Final Challenge?” Big Al asks.[/p]
        [p]“Of course not!” you say. “LET ME DOWN!”[/p]
        [p]“We'll let you down – but not until you face The Final Challenge. One spin will decide your fate. If you win, you go. If you lose, you stay here forever.”[/p]

        [p]They both ignore you and charge straight ahead. You follow them into a narrow tunnel that leads to the boarding area.[/p]
        [p]You gaze down at the floor. Black rubber. It makes you walk with a strange bounce.[/p]
        [p]Every few feet there is a round porthole window. When you glance out one, you see astronauts planting flags on the moon. You peer out another. Now they're seated in their capsule. This is amazing, you think. The figures look real. Totally real.[/p]
        [p]After a long climb, you and Patty and Brad finally arrive at the loading area.[/p]
        [p]A sleek bullet-shaped capsule [em]whooshes[/em] up and stops right beside you. It has three sections. Brad climbs defiantly into the last section. You leap into the front. Patty's left with the middle section.[/p]

        [p]“Follow me!” you yell out to Patty and Brad as you squeeze through the opening. It leads to a backstage area – and then to the flap of another tent.[/p]
        [p]You can hear the crowd behind you, trying to follow you through the crack.[/p]
        [p]“Come on! We can slip under this tent,” you say. For once, no one argues with you.[/p]

        [p]At that moment a huge gust of air shoots up from under you and blows you back onto the bridge.[/p]
        [p]Breathing hard, you run the rest of the way across the rickety span. When you reach the safety of the other side, you glance back. And gasp! The bridge and the midway beyond it have vanished! Only a black void remains![/p]
        [p]“Wow! Awesome special effects!” you cry out loud. But was your fall part of the special effects, too? It didn't feel like it.[/p]
        [p]You spin around to face the House of Horrors. Up close it appears really, really creepy. Cobwebs drip down from its roof and an eerie yellow light glows inside. Cool!

        [p]But he's nothing compared to the “things” in back of him – two seven-foot-tall monsters. One has blue horns and bulging red eyes. The other has scaly skin and an alligator snout that snaps open and closed as he eyes you.[/p]
        [p]The trio all wear lab coats. And from the eager way they're looking at you, you realize that you are the lab rat.[/p]
        [p]You struggle to escape from the net. But you're trapped in the webbing. Like a fly in a spider's web.[/p]
        [p]“Welcome to my humble laboratory,” the short man says. “I am Dr. Frank N. Stone, the mastermind who created the Carnival of Horrors.”[/p]

        [p]Your boat glides through the channel at high speed to Booger Bog. Water sprays up into your face. But soon you have to slow down. Trees have suddenly sprung up all around you. You're completely surrounded now by their towering trunks.[/p]
        [p]In the dark light, their limbs take on the shape of gnarled arms with blackened, bony fingers at the ends. You stare hard at the tree trunks. Could it be? Are they reaching out for you?[/p]
        [p]You slowly weave the boat through the twisted trunks and branches. They've grown so thick here that you can barely pilot your boat through them.[/p]
        [p]The trees rustle as if they're whispering to each other. Their limbs begin to sway. As you glide carefully through the water, the leaves slap against your face. [em]Slap. Slap. Slap.[/em][/p]

        [p]When you reach the rides, you can only stare in amazement. These are the most fantastic rides you've ever seen. The towering roller coaster … the soaring speedboats … the twisty slides!

        [p]Your fingers reach out. Out over the alligator's open snout to the top of his head.[/p]
        [p]And you pet him.[/p]
        [p]“Nice alligator,” you purr as you stroke his scaly head.[/p]
        [p]Your arm trembles, but you don't stop. And slowly – very slowly – the creature's mouth begins to shut.[/p]
        [p]Then he rolls over and falls asleep![/p]
        [p]You slip quietly off the log, charge for the shore – and plow right into Big Al![/p]
        [p]“Well, well, well. Look who we have here,” Big Al sings out. “Come with me. It's time for The Final Challenge.”[/p]

        [p]The tracks stretch up so high that they seem to touch the clouds. Your gaze follows one of the cars speeding around a sharp curve. It looks like the space shuttle. You notice that it has a safety harness that locks over your body – you've seen those before. They keep you in when the ride turns upside down. You didn't want to admit it before, but, like Brad, riding upside down is not your favorite thing.[/p]
        [p]Still, the coaster does look amazing – one part enters a tunnel – and you can see that the cars go fast. Really fast![/p]
        [p]You're just about to walk through the Space Coaster gate when you hear spooky organ music coming from behind you. You turn around. Looming in the distance is a dark and creepy haunted house.[/p]
        [p]You gaze down at your map. It's called the Little House of Horrors. Hmmm. You love haunted houses. And this one really looks scary.[/p]
        [p]Now you're not sure what to do. You won't have time for everything. The coaster or the haunted house? Decide now.[/p]

        [p]I hope Patty knows what she's doing, you think as you try to catch up. Because right now, it doesn't look that way.[/p]
        [p]Patty leads you through a maze of underground passageways. Then, just as you're about to yell, “Stop!” – she does. And you find yourself standing outside, in front of a barbed-wire fence![/p]
        [p]Up ahead, you spot an opening.[/p]
        [p]“Let's go in!” Patty says.[/p]
        [p]The three of you creep through the fence and trudge through some tall, wet grass. You gaze around. It's way too dark to see.[/p]
        [p]But you can hear perfectly. And the sounds that reach your ears make your skin crawl.[/p]
        [p]Slithering. You definitely hear slithering.[/p]
        [p]And hissing.[/p]
        [p]You want to leave. You spin around, but you can't find the opening in the fence! You do see something else. A sign![/p]

        [p]The wheel stops on [span class="attribute"]free spin[/span]. You are ready to try again. But the dumb parrot flies over and latches onto your shoulder.[/p]
        [p]“Ouch! That hurts,” you cry.[/p]
        [p]“Free spin, free spin, you're going on a free spin.”[/p]
        [p]“Turn me loose,” you command. When you swivel your head to glare at the bird, a scream freezes in your throat. The parrot has ballooned into an enormous vulture. His black, beady eyes pierce right through you. He digs his razor-sharp claws deeper into your shoulder.[/p]
        [p]Run! – your every survival instinct shouts. But the bird of prey has other ideas. One of them is dinner – with you as the main course.[/p]
        [p]The big bird snatches you by the back of your shirt as if you were a rag doll. Kicking and screaming and using every defensive move you learned from karate class, you struggle for your life. But it's no use. With a jerk he lifts you off the ground.[/p]
        [p]And suddenly you have a frightening view of the carnival from twenty feet… thirty feet … fifty feet up.[/p]

        [p][em]Thummp, thump, thump.[/em] Your heart bangs loudly inside your chest. What kind of carnival is this, you wonder, where a free spin is more like a death sentence?[/p]
        [p]You circle a green clump of treetops. You're really dizzy now. You want to close your eyes. But you know it's not a good idea – since you're flying fifty feet high without a plane or a parachute.[/p]
        [p]As you circle closer to the treetops, you are met with a horrifying view. Five baby vultures in a nest, five very hungry babies, with mouths gaping wide open.[/p]
        [p]The end is near. You are going to wind up as a take-home dinner. Unless you can somehow force the vulture to let you go. Frantically, you reach into your pockets![/p]

        [p]Then he turns to the monsters. “Okay,” he barks. “Adjust the net. It's time to practice spiking.”[/p]
        [p]Spiking? What does he mean by that?[/p]
        [p]The monsters leap up. They rub their hands together in evil delight. Then they untie the net and head to the back of the room, where two huge poles rest on the floor.[/p]
        [p]You close your eyes – and hope that when you open them, you'll see that this was all a dream. A really bad dream.[/p]
        [p]But when you open your eyes, you know it's not a dream. No – it's a volleyball game. The net has been tied to the poles – and guess what position you play? That's right. You're the ball! Watch out for those two-handed spikes! They can be pretty painful![/p]

        [p]You hear a huge bang. Smoke and fireworks fill the air as your car starts up the first big hill. Your head presses back against the seat as you climb higher and higher. That first hill is endless, but the view is awesome. From the top, you can see the midway, the haunted house, and a shadowy swamp. You can't believe how big the carnival is! “Neat!” Patty yells. “There's AHHHH – ” Whatever she was going to say turns into a wild scream as the rocket plunges down the other side of the hill. The wind whips at your face. You are pressed back so hard, you feel like a pancake. Everything passes in a fantastic blur.[/p]

        [p][em]Thrumpff![/em] Your foot plows into the doctor's stomach again. But this time, it smashes right through it. And hits … solid steel![/p]
        [p]The crunch of metal echoes in the room – along with the doctor's screams. “Aiiii!” he wails like a siren.[/p]
        [p]You gaze into the gaping hole your sneaker made. Thousands of circuits and wires burn and crackle inside it. The doctor is a robot! Well, an ex-robot now. Your kick totally destroyed him.[/p]
        [p]That's the good news.[/p]
        [p]The bad news is headed for you. It's the monster with the blue horns and red, bulging eyes.[/p]
        [p]You scramble out of the net and dash toward the door. But the monster is too quick for you. His tentacle arms shoot out and snatch you. Giant suckers at the ends of his wrists circle your throat.[/p]
        [p]You gasp for air as the monster pins you against the wall. Can you free yourself from his oozing grasp?[/p]

        [p]You spot a green neon sign flashing above a yellow-striped tent. The sign reads: [span class="attribute"]madame ZENO – FORTUNE-TELLER[/span].[/p]

        [p]There is Madame Zeno, sitting in the shadows. She wears a long red dress dotted with brightly colored gems. They shimmer in the candlelight. Her black hair tumbles to her shoulders as she bends over a large crystal ball.[/p]

        [p]Did he say, “Pleased to meet you” or “Pleased to eat you”? You're not sure, and you don't want to hang around to find out.[/p]
        [p]I've got to get out of here, you think.[/p]
        [p]As the doctor lowers his hand a bit more, you wriggle your right foot free of the netting. If you give him one hard kick in the stomach, maybe you can make a run for the door.[/p]
        [p]But what about the monsters? Can you dodge them?[/p]
        [p]You change your mind. “I'll wait – play it cool until at least one of the beasts leaves the room,” you say to yourself.[/p]
        [p]Then you change your mind again. “No. I'd better make my escape now!”[/p]
        [p]The doctor looms inches away. And you're still not sure what to do. You'd better decide fast![/p]

        [p]At the last minute, you wrench the steering wheel hard to the left. The side of your boat clears the tree with a sickening scrape.[/p]
        [p]You breathe a sigh of relief, but it ends in a groan. A huge, sharp root below the water has just ripped into the bottom of your boat. You hear a tearing sound, then gurgling as the cockpit starts to fill with water.[/p]
        [p]“Now what?” you mutter.[/p]
        [p]Then through the mist you spot another boat. But it's some distance away.[/p]
        [p]“Hey, over here!” you cry out.[/p]
        [p]Did they hear you? You cry out again. Then you glance behind you. More than half your boat is underwater – and you're going down fast.[/p]
        [p]What should you do? Keep yelling for help? Or try to swim for safety? Make your choice – QUICK![/p]

        [p]The red-eyed beast leans against you now, pressing you hard against the wall. The monster moves his face close to yours. The jagged horns at the top of his head nick your cheeks.[/p]
        [p]You can't bear it anymore. You bring your hand up with all your might and shove his head away from yours.[/p]
        [p]As you watch in horror, the monster's head rolls off its neck. The head tumbles to the floor and lands at your feet.[/p]
        [p]The eyes glance up at you, and you notice his hideous lips moving. “That hurt,” the head says. “That really h-h- ...”[/p]
        [p]He never finishes. You've destroyed another robot![/p]
        [p]“Almost out of here,” you whisper to yourself. Now all you have to do is slip by the crusty, alligator-snout creature guarding the door.[/p]
        [p]“You robots aren't so tough,” you say to him with fake bravery.[/p]
        [p]“Oh, really?” the scaly beast croaks. “Well, maybe not. But what makes you think that [em]I[/em] am a robot?”[/p]

        [p]A chill runs down your back. You feel as if a thousand pairs of eyes are watching you from the shadows.[/p]
        [p]Now that you're accustomed to the darkness, you can see dozens of tracks leading in and out of the tunnel.[/p]
        [p]And then you hear a rustling sound. You freeze. You listen hard. Could it be rats – or something worse?[/p]
        [p]You draw up your knees and wrap your arms around them tightly. Then you hear a hissing sound – and you smell something odd. It's kind of a sweet smell – like heavy perfume. You hold your nose because the smell is making you feel strange. Dizzy. Sick.[/p]

        [p]Blinking in the dim light, your eyes dart to the left. Then to the right. You spot dozens of empty space rockets lining the walls. They seem to come in sections – to make longer and shorter space rockets.[/p]
        [p]Your mind stalls working feverishly. Did your section detach from Patty and Brad's section?[/p]
        [p]Suddenly the silence is shattered. Your seat lock grinds open, and you are released from your harness. You quickly spin around. Patty's and Brad's cars have disappeared! If this is all part of the ride, maybe you should hop out. But if the ride is broken, maybe you should wait for help.[/p]

But they all offer the most amazing prizes you've ever seen – CD players, video games, fifteen-speed mountain bikes. You can't wait to play![/p]
        [p]You spot a booth across the midway with a crowd gathered in front. That's odd, you think. Didn't Big Al say we were the only people at the carnival tonight? You wonder if your friends are in the crowd. You move closer.[/p]
        [p]“Oh. I get it,” you say aloud. “These people must work at the carnival.”[/p]
        [p]You're about to call out to them. Until you see their eyes. Strange, haunted eyes.[/p]

        [p]Which number is the Doom Slide? Which one?[/p]
        [p]If you remember which number slide is the Doom Slide (or if you have the book and can look it up), choose a slide that is not the Doom Slide. If you can't remember, you'll have to leave it to luck. Pick a number between 1-10.[/p]
