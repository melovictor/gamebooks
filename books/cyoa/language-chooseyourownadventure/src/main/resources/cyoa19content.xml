        [p]You travel to Egypt with your uncle Bruce, a professor who believes that the largest pyramid at Giza can be used as an energy source.[/p]

        [p]You are relaxing one afternoon after school when you get a phone call from your uncle Bruce, a brilliant scientist and world traveler.[/p]
        [p]``I'm just in from Egypt,'' he says. ``I have to get some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a few weeks?''[/p]
        [p]You have always envied Bruce – dashing off to exotic places in the Middle East and the Orient, sometimes vanishing for months at a time. It doesn't take you long to make up your mind to go.[/p]

        [p]The next few days are a blur of preparations. Before you know it, you and Bruce are on a TWA jet heading for Rome on the first leg of the trip to Cairo.[/p]
        [p]On the plane, your uncle explains his plan to place special instruments in a chamber under the center of the largest pyramid at Giza. He hopes to test the pyramid's effect on the paths of cosmic rays – rays made up of high-speed particles from space that usually penetrate deep into the ground.[/p]
        [p]``If my theory is correct,'' he says, ``these rays could be concentrated by the pyramid to produce an unlimited amount of energy.''[/p]
        [p]While Bruce is talking, you notice that a man nearby is straining to hear him. No doubt he's just curious. He is strange-looking, though![/p]
        [p]In Rome you change to an Egyptair jet You are startled to notice the same man from the other jet aboard your Cairo-bound plane.[/p]
        [p]``I will have lots of red tape to take care of at the airport when we land,'' says Bruce. ``Why don't you just breeze through customs and take a cab to the Star and Crescent Hotel, where we're staying? My assistant, Andrea, will be waiting there for you. She can get you settled in our room while my equipment is unloaded from the plane.''[/p]
        [p]As soon as you land, Bruce is off to the baggage area, leaving you alone in a foreign land. As if that isn't enough, the stranger from the plane appears and hands you a small, folded piece of paper, then dashes toward the taxi stand outside the terminal.[/p]

        [p]Quickly you unfold the note. Scrawled in red ink are the words ``Beware the Sphinx.''[/p]
        [p]You have heard about the statue of the Sphinx next to the Pyramids. But why should you beware of it? The thought occurs to you that ``sphinx'' could be a code word and not refer to the actual Sphinx at all. Maybe the note is a meaningless hoax. On the other hand, it could spell danger for you and Bruce.[/p]
        [p]You remember the time you felt an urge to get off a bus in your hometown – just before it was hit by a truck. Now you have a hunch that you should follow this man.[/p]

        [p]There's no telling what kind of trouble you might get into if you just run off after this guy without really knowing where you are going.[/p]
        [p]You toss your bag into the back of a cab.[/p]
        [p]``Star and Crescent Hotel,'' you tell the driver.[/p]
        [p]When you arrive, Andrea is waiting for you in the lobby. She helps you check in.[/p]
        [p]The bellboy insists on carrying your bag, even though you are traveling light. As you leave the elevator and head for your room, you could swear that the door, which was slightly ajar, closed as you approached. Maybe it was the wind, but the air seems very still. And after that warning note at the airport, you don't want to take any chances.[/p]
        [p]``Wait,'' you say. ``I don't want this room. I don't like the location.''[/p]
        [p]The bellboy looks confused, and Andrea seems shocked. You haven't had a chance to tell her about the note.[/p]
        [p]``I'll explain later,'' you tell Andrea. ``Right now I'm going to go back down to the lobby and ask for a different room.''[/p]
        [p]But at the check-in desk, the clerk will not listen to you. What will you do?[/p]

        [p]``They must have hit us with a grenade,'' Mohammed says. ``It's a good thing this limo is armor-plated.''[/p]
        [p]Mohammed has been on the two-way police radio from the moment you jumped into the car. Now information comes back that the police are surrounding the area.[/p]
        [p]``They won't catch anyone,'' says Mohammed. ``These terrorists are professionals. They will disappear back into the old quarter of the city in a matter of minutes.''[/p]
        [p]Two police jeeps arrive almost immediately. Policemen begin to fan out around the area, You and Mohammed transfer to one of the jeeps, and it speeds off to Inspector Ahmed's villa, its siren wailing.[/p]

        [p]Bruce finally agrees to let you stay awhile longer. ``But we'll have to be very careful,'' he warns.[/p]
        [p]Neither of you is in the mood to go back to sleep. You leave a note under Andrea's door and go down to the lobby. Even though it is only the earliest dawn, the back streets of Cairo are bustling with activity. At one of the broader intersections, you find a cab and direct the driver to take you to Giza.[/p]
        [p]When you arrive, an Egyptian friend of your uncle is already there: Mr. Hassan, the Egyptian Director of Antiquities. It was Hassan who first persuaded your uncle to come to Egypt many years ago.[/p]
        [p]The three of you look down into the deep pit that contains the entrance to the tunnel under the pyramid. Nearby the Sphinx sits in its ageless pose.[/p]
        [p]``We had a slight problem finishing the tunnel,'' says Hassan. ``The workmen claimed that the Sphinx itself spoke to them, saying ‘Beware the Sphinx.’''[/p]

        [p]``This is Mohammed,'' says the inspector, introducing his bodyguard. ``Enjoy your sight-seeing.''[/p]
        [p]Mohammed drives you out to the famous Pyramids at Giza. A group of tourists is gathering at the foot of the largest one.[/p]
        [p]``Why don't we join this group?'' suggests Mohammed. ``It is the safest way, and you will find it informative.''[/p]
        [p]You have never liked official tours of any sort – you are too independent – but you see the logic of Mohammed's suggestion. As the group starts into the pyramid, you and Mohammed fall in behind. You enter a low, narrow passageway which leads to a large gallery with a high ceiling. The guide begins a long, dull lecture.[/p]
        [p]``Do we have to follow this tour?'' you ask Mohammed.[/p]
        [p]``If I may presume to suggest an alternative,'' says Mohammed, ``I myself was once employed as a guide in this very pyramid. If you would like me to show you some of the lesser passageways, I would be glad to guide you.''[/p]

        [p]Just as you get to the wall, a panel opens and reveals a lighted niche. Inside is a very elaborate and jeweled costume – a ceremonial costume of ancient Egypt. The humming grows even louder now. You feel compelled to exchange your clothes for the long robe, the headdress, and the sandals in front of you. You put them on. You want to stop yourself, but you can't.[/p]

        [p]Bruce seemingly agrees to cooperate, and Ptah is delighted. Bruce is sent under guard to work in the laboratory located in a vast complex under the pyramid.[/p]
        [p]A few days later, Bruce manages to talk to you without the guards overhearing.[/p]
        [p]``The Russian scientists were also kidnapped,'' whispers Bruce. ``Fortunately I can speak a little Russian. We're trying to come up with a way to escape.''[/p]
        [p]Three weeks later, the ray gun is ready for its first formal test. You, Bruce, and the Russians – as well as Ptah and his top henchmen – mount a large ceremonial stand in front of the pyramid. As Ptah watches the barrel of the ray gun emerge from the top of the pyramid, Bruce slips something into your hand.[/p]
        [p]``Put these plugs in your ears when I give you the signal,'' Bruce whispers.[/p]
        [p]Technicians inside the pyramid throw the switches to activate the ray gun. A low whirring sound fills the air. It rises in pitch as it gets louder – louder and louder, and higher and higher. Soon it begins to hurt your ears. Your arms and legs become numb, and your vision starts to blur.[/p]

        [p]``Is your uncle Professor Hockney?'' asks the inspector.[/p]
        [p]``How did you know?''[/p]
        [p]``I have been watching this hotel since he arrived. I was afraid something like this might happen.''[/p]
        [p]``I think I saw the kidnappers in a truck behind the hotel,'' you report anxiously.[/p]
        [p]You and the inspector run to the back entrance of the hotel, but the truck is gone.[/p]

        [p]The strange man is already in a cab when you reach the stand in front of the terminal. You manage to jump into the next cab in line.[/p]
        [p]``Do you speak English?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``I speak much English, [em]meestehr.[/em]''[/p]
        [p]``Good, then follow that cab,'' you tell him.[/p]
        [p]Your cab weaves in and out of the heavy traffic, with its horn blaring constantly. Your driver just barely misses one car after another. However, he does manage to keep less than a block behind the other car.[/p]
        [p]The fast-moving traffic slows to a snail's pace once you get into an older section of the city. The cab you are following stops, and the strange man gets out. You hand your driver a couple of American bills, hoping they cover your fare. Fortunately, the driver seems more than pleased as you leave the cab.[/p]
        [p]You can barely see through the thick crowd, but you do catch a glimpse of the man you are following. He is entering what looks like a cafe. You push your way over to the entrance.[/p]

        [p]You return to the hotel in a cab and check Andrea's room. No sign of her. You leave the hotel not quite knowing what to do.[/p]
        [p]At the corner a native woman, with a dark veil covering her head and face, except for the eyes, beckons from a doorway. You are surprised to see that her eyes are pale gray. You are even [em]more[/em]  surprised when you hear her voice. The woman is Andrea in disguise![/p]
        [p]``Follow me quickly,'' she says.[/p]
        [p]You have to run to keep up with her. She leads you through a labyrinth of teeming alleyways. Finally you reach a stone building with a heavy, carved door.[/p]

        [p]There may be dangers involved, but you can't let your uncle down. You tell the inspector you will go with him on the raid.[/p]
        [p]``We will leave at dawn tomorrow,'' says Ahmed. ``It is not advisable for you to go back to your hotel. My personal bodyguard will escort you today, and tonight he will bring you to my home, where you will spend the night. Perhaps you would like to tour the Pyramids today.''[/p]
        [p]``It might keep my mind off Bruce until tomorrow,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]``Then let's step outside,'' Ahmed says.[/p]
        [p]As you do, a long, black Mercedes limousine pulls up.[/p]
        [p]``This car is bulletproof, among other things,'' says Ahmed. ``You will find it quite comfortable – and safe.''[/p]

        [p]You slide down the drainpipe to the balcony below, and then begin to lower yourself to the street. You try not to look down. Carefully you reach around with your foot for whatever footholds you can find sticking out from the building. It is easier than you had expected.[/p]
        [p]Finally you make it down to the street. You can still see the truck. It's only a block away, stuck in traffic. You push your way through the crowded street as fast as you can to catch up to it.[/p]
        [p]Out of breath, you reach the back of the truck. You jump on and struggle with the doors. They fly open suddenly, and you fall back onto the street, banging your knee. Hopping painfully on one leg, you get up and pull yourself into the truck.[/p]

        [p]A screen slowly appears in one of the walls, and what looks like a movie about ancient Egypt begins. You see a pyramid being built. Workers scurry about with ropes and long poles. But they do not carry the huge blocks of stone. The stones float through the air by themselves![/p]

I've suspected for a long rime that something like this might exist It confirms a theory of mine that ancient Egyptian culture was given a big boost by a more advanced one.''[/p]
        [p]The door of the bubble is open, and Bruce jumps inside. His hand sweeps over the complex control panel.[/p]

        [p]``Bruce, are you all right?'' you call through the door. There is no answer. You throw open the door. Bruce is gone![/p]
        [p]The room is a mess. Sheets trail across the floor as if a struggle had taken place. In several places there are drops of blood. The screen covering the window has been pushed in. There are more spots of blood on the windowsill and on the small ledge outside. You look down. There is a fourstory drop to the street.[/p]
        [p]You rush back into your room and throw on some clothes. Then back to the window. It is a bit lighter now. Dawn is just breaking. On the street you see two men, loading a large basket into the back of an old panel truck. From this height – and in the still-dim light – you can't be sure, but something tells you that one of them is the stranger who gave you the note. You also have a strong suspicion that your uncle is in the basket. How did they get him down to the street?[/p]
        [p]The ledge outside the window extends only a short distance on either side. There are no other windows nearby. But there are several small balconies on the second and third floors. There is also a drainpipe on one side of the ledge. Maybe you could slide down the drainpipe to the nearest balcony and then climb down to the street.[/p]

        [p]As you approach the door it opens automatically. This startles all of you for a moment. Carefully you peer inside. You are hardly prepared for what you see.[/p]
        [p]The room is illuminated with some kind of strange light. The walls and ceiling are made of a plastic material with a honeycomb pattern, and they seem to glow with an inner luminescence. In the center, perched on a glistening metal rail, is some kind of futuristic device.[/p]

        [p]Suddenly you are caught up in a whirlwind and shot straight up through the pyramid. You look down and see the pyramid receding below you. The top of the pyramid has become a huge, glistening eye, shooting rays of light in all directions. Below it are bands of glowing color. As you concentrate on the eye, your body seems to dissolve.

        [p]Your new ``suite'' consists of two small rooms with a connecting door. The first room is windowless; the second has a small window covered by a screen of very elaborate grillwork. Andrea's room is on the other side of the hotel, not far from your original room.[/p]
        [p]Bruce arrives a short time later. You tell him about the warning note and explain why you've changed rooms.[/p]
        [p]``Splendid!'' he exclaims. ``You must always follow your hunches, especially when danger is involved. Now I suggest that we go out on the town for the evening. You don't want to miss the Sahara Club and its famous belly dancers.''[/p]

        [p]``I think we had better go down to my office,'' says Ahmed. ``I want you to look through my photo file.''[/p]
        [p]The inspector's office at headquarters is cluttered but organized in its own way. A row of file cabinets lines one side of the room. Ahmed pulls out a folder, opens it on one of the few bare sections of his long desk, and spreads out a collection of photographs for you to study.[/p]
        [p]Somehow you are not surprised to see the man from the plane in one of the photos. You tell Ahmed the whole story.[/p]
        [p]``The man you recognize is a member of the Assassins,'' says Ahmed. ``This just confirms what I told you before. Through informers, I have discovered the secret desert headquarters of the Assassins. There is a strike force of paratroopers and a dozen helicopters waiting to attack. We must act as soon as possible.''[/p]
        [p]``If you are going to raid the hideout of the kidnappers,'' you say, ``I think I should go along.''[/p]

        [p]``Anything would be better than this lecture,'' you say. ``Those other passageways sound exciting.''[/p]
        [p]You follow Mohammed into a narrow tunnel. At one point he stops and feels along the wall. One of the stones in the wall slides back, and a small, very low door opens.[/p]
        [p]``Quickly,'' says Mohammed, ``we must get inside before anyone comes.'' Mohammed enters the long, horizontal shaft. The passageway is so low that you have to crawl on your hands and knees. You hear a click as the stone door behind you slides back into place. You hope Mohammed knows where he is going![/p]
        [p]You and Mohammed crawl for quite a while. Finally you come to a large square chamber. The walls are white with blue and gold hieroglyphs painted in neat rows around the room. In the exact center of the floor is a round hole.[/p]
        [p]``That is what we call the Well of the Ancients,'' says Mohammed.[/p]
        [p]``You mean that you can draw water from down there?''[/p]
        [p]``There are many things other than water that can be drawn from a well – wisdom, perhaps,'' replies Mohammed. ``This well is very deep. Here – drop this in the well and see if you can hear when it hits bottom.''[/p]

        [p]Mohammed hands you a small coin. It is triangular with an elaborate design in the center. A tiny, just barely visible hieroglyphic inscription runs around the edge. The coin shines as if made of gold.[/p]
        [p]You throw the coin in and put your ear close to the well. For a full minute you hear nothing. Then you hear a strange humming – a high musical note that vibrates both in the well and inside your head. You turn to look at Mohammed, but he seems to have disappeared.[/p]
        [p]Suddenly you feel as if you are losing your balance. You are falling into the well.[/p]

        [p]You go back up to the room and unpack your small suitcase. You make a careful search. There is no sign that an intruder has been there, and you feel relieved. Your room turns out to be a suite, with a bedroom, a sitting room, a small bathroom, and two tiny closets. The bedroom windows are covered with elaborately patterned grillwork. Andrea's room is on the same floor, down the hall.[/p]
        [p]Bruce finally arrives and you show him the note. For a moment he looks alarmed. Then he smiles. ``Well, I suggest we forget about it for the moment and go out on the town,'' he says. ``I know this great spot called the Sahara Club where we can get a delicious meal of shish kebab – and even watch some genuine Egyptian belly dancing.''[/p]
        [p]When you arrive back at the hotel later, you are very tired. Andrea goes to her room, Bruce retires to the bedroom, and you quickly fall asleep on the couch in the sitting room.[/p]

        [p]Suddenly a troop of desert warriors on camels appears from nowhere and comes charging toward you. Dark headcloths cover their faces except for their eyes. But instead of the old, long rifles you have seen them carrying in pictures, they all have modern submachine guns – and they are all pointed at you.[/p]
        [p]One of the warriors commands you to raise your hands and march toward the pyramids.[/p]
        [p]A door opens in the base of one of the smaller pyramids, and you and Ahmed are forced into the vault inside. The door snaps shut behind you. You realize that the ``floor'' you're standing on is a conveyor belt that is rapidly carrying you toward a wall of flame at the other end of the vault. You try frantically to run back to the door, but the belt is too fast. You are both swept into the thermal chamber – a chamber that so concentrates the energy of the sun that any object entering it is instantly vaporized.[/p]

My image is programmed to respond to individual personalities such as yours. Even though you may feel my arm as solid – here, I will touch your hand – it is only an illusion. It is too complex to explain, but your descendants will understand someday, just as [em]you[/em]  know that when you listen to a radio there are not little people in the box making the sounds.''[/p]
        [p]``You are the most celebrated character in Egyptian history,'' says Hassan. ``You were – or are – the greatest genius that ever lived.''[/p]
        [p]``It is true that I gave your species a bit of help. I taught them the rudiments of architecture, farming, mathematics, engineering, and medicine. That was five thousand years ago. But I am not sure I was wise to do it. I will have to decide that when I find time to return. Your planet is in my study quadrant, but it is far out on the edge of the galaxy.''[/p]

Other pyramids were built to imitate this shape so that the secret could be protected until the right time.''[/p]
        [p]The door to the module reopens, and the three of you step out into the sunlight.[/p]
        [p]``This is the greatest discovery of my life,'' Bruce says after a few moments of silence. ``This is even more exciting than what I had hoped to find when I came to Egypt. It would be catastrophic if this secret fell into the wrong hands. But if we use its information properly, we might be able to solve all of the problems of the world.''[/p]

        [p]``All in good time, all in good time. First, I must explain to you that I am Ptah, direct descendant of the pharaohs. I am here to complete their work. I intend to conquer the world.''[/p]
        [p]``And just how do you plan to pull off that little feat?'' asks Bruce.[/p]
        [p]``With your help, of course, Professor. Several Russian scientists were on the verge of completing a particle-beam ray gun. By various means I have had them brought here. They have almost completed their work. And now, with you to help them, they will be done in no time at all. When it is finished, the ray will be directed at a mirror on a space platform that I have already placed in orbit around the earth. I will then be able to bounce the ray back to any point on earth, utterly destroying the targets that I choose. If you refuse to help me, you will be imprisoned on the space platform. I give you exactly one hour to make up your mind.''[/p]

        [p]``Dr. Ptah! Who is that?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]But Bruce has no time to answer. The plane is landing. The door of the small compartment opens. Three men grab you and Bruce by the ankles and pull you out of the plane, dumping you on the ground like two sacks of potatoes.[/p]
        [p]You look around. You're at one end of a long, narrow, sandy island, bare except for a few palm trees and a large pyramid-shaped building. Down the beach there is a pier with a motor launch moored to it. One of the men cuts the ropes on your feet and wrists, then does the same for Bruce. More men appear, carrying rifles.[/p]
        [p]``All right,'' one of them orders, ``you two march toward the building over there.''[/p]
        [p]As you walk, you realize just how large the pyramid building is. Though clearly not a solid structure like the ancient pyramids – it has rows of windows at various heights – it is still twenty or thirty stories high. A large mast of some sort rises from the top. The mast is bent sideways to a crazy angle.[/p]
        [p]An electronically controlled door slides open at the base of the pyramid, and you are pushed inside.[/p]
        [p]``Take them to the throne room,'' you hear one of the guards order.[/p]

        [p]The three of you just make it back into the tunnel when an explosion rocks the room and a section of the floor crashes into some unknown abyss below. Then there is silence. Clouds of dust rise from the gaping hole. You wait for several minutes, hardly daring to breathe.[/p]
        [p]``I think that's all that is going to happen for the moment,'' says Hassan.[/p]
        [p]``Hold on to my legs,'' says Bruce. He crawls back into the room and leans over the edge of the opening, playing his flashlight down into the space below. ``Seems to be some kind of chamber, probably an ancient tomb. The floor is about fifteen feet down. It's lucky we brought a rope along.''[/p]

You and Serena jump onto the cot. She cups her hands to give your foot a boost up. Her lift sends you sailing through the window.[/p]

        [p]You agree. After a couple of hours of walking through museums, touring ancient mosques and city walls, and looking at parks and monuments, you are very tired. Mohammed finds a colorful cafe on one of the broad boulevards in the modern section of Cairo where you can sit and watch the people go by. You have been sitting there for awhile when you notice that Mohammed seems very uneasy.[/p]

        [p]You stay on the platform and the walls of the chamber re-form around you. The triangular screen reappears, and the images change and flash before you faster and faster. You see more pyramids being built. Now a different culture takes hold. You recognize the Romans in their military helmets. Christian crosses begin to appear. Churches are built, then swept away in a flash. You recognize the signs of Islam, the mosques with their minarets. Then you get a brief glimpse of Napoleon in his characteristic pose, hand in jacket, before the Pyramids. Then a sign of modern times: an airplane flies over.[/p]
        [p]The screen fades for a moment. When the images continue, you see tall, strange-looking structures in the distance and flying machines of a design you don't recognize. The screen blurs again. The Pyramids are still there, but the tall structures in the background are gone. The area behind the Pyramids – to the horizon – has been transformed into a green, tree-dotted park. Finally the screen goes blank.[/p]

        [p]After dinner you toss and turn for hours. It is difficult for you to sleep, worrying about Bruce. Finally you do fall asleep. When you wake up, it is already late in the morning.

        [p]Just before dawn the next morning you and Ahmed leave in his small scout helicopter.[/p]
        [p]You fly east across the desert. The faintest light begins to creep along the edge of the sky. Then a thin layer of red, like glowing embers, grows along the horizon.[/p]
        [p]``I plan to mark the route to the terrorists' camp by dropping small smoke bombs in the desert at twenty-mile intervals,'' Ahmed explains. ``The troop-carrying helicopters will leave from a nearby army base in half an hour. They will follow the smoke trail.''[/p]
        [p]As the huge, fiery disc of the sun floats majestically up into the sky, Ahmed notices some dark clouds low on the horizon to the southeast.[/p]
        [p]Soon strong gusts of wind begin to buffet the helicopter. Ahmed radios the base.[/p]
        [p]``Come in, ground control. Abort mission for the present. Weather conditions unfavorable.''[/p]
        [p]Ahmed begins a wide bank to the north. The wind is stronger now, and steady. The air is filled with a strange fog. The helicopter begins to cough.[/p]
        [p]``The dust is beginning to clog the air intake of the engine,'' says Ahmed. ``The air filter can handle normal dust conditions, but we've blundered into a sandstorm.''[/p]

        [p]You can't complete the sentence – you feel yourself blacking out.[/p]
        [p]You awaken outside the pyramid. You are lying on the ground, and Mohammed is putting a damp cloth on your forehead.[/p]

        [p]Where are you? The pale moon lights up an eerie landscape. Stretching in every direction are small buildings, all deserted. You wander up and down the silent streets until you finally see a group of people huddled in front of a small fire. The night is cool, and they gesture for you to join them. You stay with them until dawn.[/p]
        [p]With the light of day you realize that you are in a very large cemetery. Those small buildings must be tombs! You're not sure of the way out, but you pick a direction and keep going. Finally you reach a small store just outside the cemetery. You find a telephone and call Bruce at the hotel.[/p]

        [p]``Not long ago,'' says Bruce, ``I discovered the entrance to an underwater tunnel that goes from the Nile to the famous step pyramid at Sakkara. They say Imhotep's tomb is there. I haven't had a chance to explore this tunnel until now.''[/p]
        [p]When you reach Sakkara, the car enters the underwater runnel. Soon you surface on a broad lake in an underground cavern. In the center of the lake is an island, and in the center of the island is a small pyramid about thirty feet high. It is made of a dull, silvery metal – perhaps platinum. Bruce steers the car to the edge of the island. The three of you jump ashore. As you do, a large opening appears in the side of the pyramid. A voice comes from inside.[/p]
        [p]``If you wish to know the secret of Imhotep, and the secret of the Pyramids,'' says the voice, ``then all of you must step inside.''[/p]
        [p]``I guess it's all or nothing,'' says Bruce.[/p]
        [p]Andrea and Bruce want to go in – which leaves it up to you.[/p]

        [p]A waiter brings you a long-handled pot containing thick, strong coffee. He pours it ceremoniously into a small porcelain cup. It tastes somewhat bitter, but not too bad. You sip it slowly as you watch the dancing. Is it your imagination, or does the dancer keep glancing in your direction?[/p]
        [p]The music grows louder. The lights get brighter. You can't seem to focus your eyes. Your arms and legs feel like lead, and you can't move them. You feel dizzy. You feel like you are passing out![/p]

        [p]``OK,'' says Bruce, ``let's all three give it a shot.''[/p]
        [p]You feel a lot better going along than waiting alone in that spooky room.[/p]
        [p]As soon as you are on board, Bruce pushes one of the buttons on the control panel. There is a whirring sound and the door of the strange craft slides shut with an ominous click.[/p]
        [p]The bubble starts smoothly along the rail and into the tunnel. After a minute or so, it slows to a stop. The bubble door opens and the three of you climb out. You find yourselves in a chamber almost identical to the one you just left. However, this room seems to have no exit. This does not seem logical to you. Whoever created this transportation system would hardly have built it just for the ride.[/p]
        [p]On a hunch, you feel carefully along the wall. Jackpot! Two triangular panels recess into the wall and slide apart, revealing a large room with slanted walls.[/p]
        [p]``Good work,'' says Bruce.[/p]
        [p]The three of you enter. As you look around you realize that you are in a room shaped like the inside of a pyramid.[/p]
        [p]Suddenly the triangular door closes behind you and disappears. You are trapped inside! The walls – four perfect triangles – begin to glow brighter and brighter.[/p]

        [p]Up ahead you see another oasis. Is it another mirage? You head for it anyway. One part of the desert is as good as any other when it comes to leaving your sun-dried bones.[/p]
        [p]You get there first. ``This is water! Actual water!'' you exclaim. ``This is not a mirage!''[/p]
        [p]You dunk your entire head in the water. Nothing has ever felt better in your life.[/p]
        [p]Later, when you are both rested, Ahmed says, ``Some of these palm trees are date palms with fruit We will have enough food and water until the next caravan arrives. It is only a matter of time before we are rescued.''[/p]

        [p]You repeat Al-Din's spell three times. The room begins to spin around you, then fades away altogether. You seem to be floating in a void. Are you asleep? Dreaming? You find yourself flying high up over the ocean on what could be a magic carpet.[/p]
        [p]You awaken in your living room back home. The phone is ringing. You answer it. Your uncle is on the phone.[/p]
        [p]``I'm just in from Egypt,'' he says. ``I have to get some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a few weeks?''[/p]

        [p]``I'm sure the radio message got through,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]``I think so too,'' says Ahmed. ``The best thing to do is to wait where we are.''[/p]
        [p]Ahmed digs around in the sand where you crouched during the storm.[/p]
        [p]``Here they are,'' says Ahmed, ``the smoke bombs. I was afraid that I had lost them. Each one of these will send out smoke for an hour.''[/p]
        [p]Ahmed sets off one of the bombs. A tall column of smoke rises in the now still air.[/p]
        [p]The last one is set off late in the afternoon. ``This is it,'' says Ahmed. ``If no one sees this smoke, we may be out of luck.''[/p]
        [p]Just as the smoke begins to disappear, you hear the drone of a plane. It banks and makes a low pass over you.[/p]
        [p]``They see us!'' you shout, jumping up and down on the sand.[/p]
        [p]The plane, which belongs to the Egyptian Air Force, lands nearby. You are saved this time. You wonder how many adventures lie ahead before you get back to the States.[/p]

        [p]You might as well take a chance and try the jump. You step back a few feet, make a short run, and take a flying leap to the other roof. You manage to grab the edge with your hands as you slip down along the side of the building. You struggle to pull yourself up. You are about to lose your grip when a strong arm grabs you by the wrist and heaves you onto the roof. It's Serena![/p]
        [p]``Wow!'' you exclaim. ``Are all belly dancers as strong as you are?''[/p]
        [p]``I was trained to be an acrobat by my family,'' she says, ``before I was kidnapped by the evil gang that owns the cafe.''[/p]
        [p]``Why haven't you tried to escape before?'' you ask.[/p]
        [p]``I have,'' she says, ``but it's not that easy. They control this quarter of Cairo completely. Now my family has discovered where I am and has arranged my escape – but you will see. We must hurry. I hear someone coming.''[/p]

        [p]You pull open the door and dash down a corridor that leads back into the cafe. You run outside. Two men from the cafe race after you, shouting in Arabic. You push your way through the crowds, trying to stay hidden. Which way to go? There is an open door on your right with a small courtyard inside. You decide to chance it and dart through the door, slamming it behind you. You lean against the door, gasping for breath.[/p]
        [p]A hulk of a man appears. He has a heavy, dark beard and piercing eyes.[/p]
        [p]``Welcome to my house,'' he says. ``Have you come to buy a magic spell or perhaps something to ward off the evil eye?''[/p]
        [p]``I need help,'' you say. ``Someone is after me.''[/p]
        [p]``In that case, you are welcome in my humble house. You are safe here. I am Al-Din, the magician. My magic will protect you.''[/p]
        [p]You follow Al-Din up a flight of stairs into a room with a low table surrounded by cushions. He serves you some mint tea and tells you about the ancient magic he practices.[/p]
        [p]``All is illusion,'' he says. ``Here, I will show you. Close your eyes and repeat this spell three times: [em]abah arah arah abah blah ah.[/em]''[/p]

        [p]The room you enter is dark, and it takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust to the light. When they do, you see Andrea in front of you with a revolver in her hand, silencer and all. The gun is pointed at you.[/p]
        [p]``Kill! I must kill...'' she says in a mechanicalsounding voice. Her eyes are glassy, as if she were hypnotized.[/p]
        [p]``Andrea, what are you saying?'' you gasp.[/p]
        [p]``The secrets must be protected... must be protected...'' she continues in that same strange voice. It sounds almost like a recording.[/p]
        [p]You realize with a shudder that Andrea's mind has been taken over by some evil force.[/p]
        [p]``Andrea!'' you shout. ``I don't [em]know[/em]  any secrets. I don't even know what's going on. Someone has done something to you. You don't know what you are doing.''[/p]
        [p]She raises the gun to fire.[/p]

        [p]You turn to face your pursuers. Then you recognize them.[/p]
        [p]``Bruce! Andrea!'' you exclaim. ``It's you. How did you get here?''[/p]
        [p]``The cab driver who brought you here was worried,'' Bruce says. ``He went to the police and they called us.''[/p]
        [p]Suddenly you realize that you've got to stop Serena from running away. The three of you can help her.[/p]
        [p]``Serena, come back!'' you shout. ``These are my friends.''[/p]
        [p]The sound of your voice echoes across the rooftops, but there is no reply.[/p]
        [p]You, Bruce, and Andrea return to the hotel. Your parents are on the overseas phone. They have begun to worry about you and insist that you return home.[/p]

        [p]``If that's your honest choice,'' says Bruce, ``Andrea and I will respect it. And in that case, I guess we'll all stay out.''[/p]

        [p]Serena leads you down a long flight of stairs.[/p]
        [p]You follow her through passageways that are so narrow you can barely squeeze through. Sometimes you can hear shouting nearby and see the flickering beams of flashlights searching the dark corners where you were standing only seconds before. Finally, in a narrow alley, Serena stops and listens for a few moments.[/p]
        [p]``See that donkey cart over there,'' she whispers. ``It is from my village. I have arranged for it to meet me here. I will crawl into the bottom of it. Watch how I do it, then follow.''[/p]
        [p]There is just room enough for you to squeeze into the cart. Serena arranges the straw over the two of you and then signals to the driver with a low whistle.[/p]
        [p]The cart starts off. You go through narrow alleyways, then down larger streets. Gradually the street noises die away, and you guess that you are outside the city.[/p]
        [p]``I think we are safely away from our pursuers,'' says Serena. ``If you wish, you may find your way from here. If you continue with me to my village, you will be welcome there.''[/p]

        [p]``I think you're right,'' says Bruce. ``When the guards come for us, we'll jump them. I don't think they expect us to fight back. It might take them by surprise.''[/p]
        [p]``At least we won't be giving up without a struggle,'' you say.[/p]
        [p]The guards [em]are[/em]  taken by surprise. The fight is brief and furious, but there are just too many of them. The guards overpower you and drag you back to Ptah.[/p]

        [p]You are already working your hands free as you blast off.[/p]
        [p]``The crew is going to be too busy for awhile to bother about us,'' you say. ``If we can break out of this compartment and get the jump on them, maybe we can take over the ship. Then we can put Ptah's space station out of action for good.''[/p]

        [p]You ride for another few hours. There is utter silence except for the clip-clop of the donkey's hooves and the creak of the wheels. You drift off to sleep. Sometime later Serena shakes you gently.[/p]
        [p]``We are here, at my village, and with my people.''[/p]
        [p]You crawl out of the cart. Dawn is just breaking. You are near a field. In the center you see a large bonfire. Around the fire are hundreds of figures in white turbans and white robes. They are chanting in unison – it's an eerie sound. Then the figures rise and begin to move together around the fire in a strange, slow dance, rolling their heads and chanting, ``[em]Allah-Allah-ah-ah.[/em]'' The hypnotic effect of the dancing draws you in, and you join the circle.[/p]
