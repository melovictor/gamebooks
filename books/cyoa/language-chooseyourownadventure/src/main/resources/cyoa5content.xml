        [p]On your vacation in Connecticut, you notice a huge, empty stone house at the top of a hill. Some of the windows are boarded up. Some are covered with vines. The old house, known as “Chimney Rock,” is so dark and gloomy that most people won't go near it.[/p]
        [p]But you're the curious type. Should you see for yourself what's inside? Your cousin urges you to go ahead.[/p]
        [p]What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices [em]you[/em] make. How does the story end? Only you can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not [em]one[/em], but [em]many[/em] incredibly daring experiences![/p]

        [p]Vacation is here and you're visiting your cousins Michael and Jane for a few days at their new home in Connecticut. Soon after you arrive, they take you on a tour of their neighborhood, along shady streets lined with cozy houses with neatly-trimmed lawns. At the top of a hill you notice a huge stone house unlike any you have ever seen. It has turrets, walled terraces and a square tower that looks like a giant chimney. Some of the windows are boarded up and others are hidden by vines and bushes. There is a big dog chained in front of the little cottage nearby, and you ask your cousins if anyone lives in the main house.[/p]
        [p]“Chimney Rock? Most people around here wouldn't live there for a million dollars,” Michael says.[/p]
        [p]“It's supposed to be cursed,” Jane adds. “They say that some people who have gone inside have never been seen again. What happened to them is still a mystery.”[/p]

        [p]“You see,” Michael explains, “Mrs. Bigley lived in Chimney Rock alone with her cat for many years. When she died, she left instructions in her will that the cat could live there for the rest of its life. People say that she put a curse on the house so that no one would bother the cat.”[/p]
        [p]“Haven't the police investigated?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“The police never found anyone – only the cat,” Michael says, “but some people say Mrs. Bigley never died at all – and that she's still living there herself!”[/p]
        [p]“What does the caretaker say?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“He doesn't say anything,”Michael replies. “Some say he's crazy, and some say he's just mean, but I guess he's afraid of the curse too, because I hear he won't set foot inside Chimney Rock.”[/p]
        [p]“You're not kidding?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“If you think we're kidding,” Michael says, “why don't you go inside?”[/p]

        [p]“I'll do it,” you say.[/p]
        [p]“OK,” Michael replies. “When are you going? Jane and I will watch you.”[/p]
        [p]“We'll want to say good-by to you,” Jane says.[/p]
        [p]You take time to get a flashlight from the house, and then the three of you set off for Chimney Rock. You feel a bit nervous, but it's a beautiful day, and you keep telling yourself there is really nothing to worry about.[/p]
        [p]As you approach it, the house looks bleak and forbidding, like some medieval fortress. A dark cloud passes in front of the sun. The wind blows dust in your eyes. You wish you hadn't agreed to go inside. But it's too late to back out now, so, while Michael and Jane watch from a distance, you walk around the house and try all the doors. Every one of them is locked except for one in the back of the house. You wave to your cousins, open the door and walk into an entryway that leads to a large kitchen. There are rows of sinks and counters and a huge black oven. The floor is laid with dark red tiles, many of them chipped or loose. The windows are covered with cloth shades, and you raise one of them to let in more light.[/p]
        [p]On your right is a flight of steps leading from the kitchen upstairs; to the left is a swinging door, which you imagine leads to the dining room.[/p]

        [p]When you say “no thanks,” Michael replies, “Well, I don't blame you.”[/p]
        [p]“I'll go in,” Jane says, “even if you two are afraid, but only on one condition! That you'll come after me if I don't come out within five minutes.”[/p]
        [p]You and Michael can hardly refuse, so the three of you walk up the road to Chimney Rock. There is no sign of the caretaker or anyone else. You circle the house, trying all the doors. Jane finds one that is unlocked. While you and Michael watch, she opens it and walks inside.[/p]
        [p]You suspect that Jane is standing just inside the door and will come out when the five minutes are up. But five, then six and then seven minutes go by. You exchange worried glances with Michael.[/p]
        [p]“I guess we better go in after her,” you say.[/p]
        [p]“I'm going to get help,” he replies. “You stand watch.”[/p]
        [p]Before you can answer, he goes running off toward the road.[/p]

        [p]You start up the stairs, trying to make as little noise as possible. The railing is falling off, and the dust and cobwebs get thicker each step of the way until you reach the landing, which is dimly lit by pale yellow light coming through a circular stained glass window. Steps continue up in two directions from the landing, but on the same level is a hall leading to a door that is slightly ajar. You walk up to it and gently push it open.[/p]
        [p]Before you is a dingy room filled with furniture and trunks, an old-fashioned radio, a grandfather clock, a rocking horse, some coils of rope, piles of books and, on the dusty floor, a dead mouse. In the back of the room is a large closet.[/p]

        [p]You walk through the swinging door and into an elegant dining room. A splendid crystal chandelier hangs over the long oak table. Double bay windows are partly hidden by dark green, satin curtains. A bottle of wine rests on a silver tray on the sideboard. Next to it is a bright green china cat.[/p]
        [p]You sit down at the table and ponder the situation. There is a small, brass bell within reach, and on impulse, you ring it.[/p]
        [p]Within a few moments, a door you hadn't noticed before opens, and a thin, young woman walks in. She is wearing a black dress and a little white hat in the fashion of a maid.[/p]
        [p]“Oh,” she says, looking at you with surprise, “I didn't know Mrs. Bigley was expecting a guest today. I'm Lena. May I bring you anything? Perhaps cheese and crackers – you must be hungry.”[/p]

        [p]While you are waiting for Michael, you walk around the house, tapping on the windows and doors. They are locked – even the back door through which Jane entered. She must be imprisoned inside.[/p]
        [p]You see Jervis, the caretaker, going into his cottage. Maybe he will help you.[/p]
        [p]But there is another possibility. There is a thick vine wrapped around a pillar that supports a balcony over the side porch. It looks as though you could climb it and perhaps get into the house through the windows off the balcony.[/p]

        [p]Almost as soon as you step inside the house, you hear a muffled cry for help. It's Jane! Following the sound of her voice, you run through the kitchen, fling open the swinging door to the dining room, and make your way through the dark, musty library and into the front hall. You find her there, huddled behind the grand staircase.[/p]
        [p]“What happened? Are you all right?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“If only you can help me!” she cries. “I'm trapped.”[/p]
        [p]“Trapped?”[/p]
        [p]“Yes! I was looking around the house and I found a cat sitting right where we are now – it must be Melissa – and I went up to pat her, but she gave me a terrible look; she seemed to be laughing at me. Then she began pacing back and forth – as if there were bars there between us. Finally, she went away, but [em]I feel as if the bars are still there[/em], and that if I try to go through them something terrible will happen.”[/p]
        [p]You are unable to convince Jane that she has nothing to fear.[/p]

        [p]You make your way through the furniture scattered about the room and open the door to the closet. It smells of moth balls and is filled with clothes, some very old, some quite new. You notice a policeman's uniform, and a large key ring with three keys on it hanging from a nail.[/p]
        [p]You are suddenly startled by a squeaky noise. It is only a mouse scurrying across the room. You walk back toward the door. The mouse comes running right at you! You step back, ready to kick it away, but suddenly it rolls over on its side, dead.[/p]
        [p]You rush out of the room toward the stairs. Then, as you collect your wits, you remember the keys, and wonder if they might come in handy.[/p]

        [p]The storeroom is a creepy place; you are glad to be out of it. When you reach the landing, you notice something you hadn't seen before – a brass ring set in the floor. You tug at the ring, and a square portion of the floor comes up. You pull it wide open, exposing a narrow circular staircase leading to a room below.[/p]
        [p]There is just enough light to see by, and you start climbing down the stairs, curious as to where they lead. Suddenly, you hear a crash overhead. The trap door has slammed shut.[/p]

        [p]You really are hungry and thank Lena for the offer, but ask if she has anything else besides cheese and crackers. Smiling, she goes out and returns a moment later with some delicious-looking brownies. You pick one up and take a very small bite. It tastes even better than it looks, and you can't resist eating it all.[/p]
        [p]In a moment your eyes become blurry. You feel as if you have been drugged. You ring the bell, but Lena does not return. You get up and start toward the door, but you feel yourself falling.[/p]
        [p]Sometime later you awaken, feeling weak and confused. It is pitch dark.[/p]

        [p]“No thanks,” you reply. “I had heard this house is occupied only by Mrs. Bigley's cat. But I guess Mrs. Bigley still lives here too. If I'd known that, I wouldn't have barged in.”[/p]
        [p]“Oh, Mrs. Bigley doesn't mind. I'm sure she was expecting you. She [em]loves[/em] to have visitors,” Lena says.[/p]
        [p]“I'm glad of that,” you reply. “But where is she?”[/p]
        [p]“She is upstairs in the music room, playing the piano.” Lena answers.[/p]

        [p]Before Jane realizes what you are doing, you pull her through the imaginary bars.[/p]
        [p]“Melissa must have put a spell on me,” she says.[/p]
        [p]“Just a little spell,” you reply. “Let's find that cat. We'll end its curse on Chimney Rock.”[/p]
        [p]At that moment, you hear a meowing from the top of the stairs. The two of you run up to the top landing.[/p]
        [p]“You look to the right and I'll go left.” Jane says.[/p]
        [p]There is no sign of the cat in the hall, so you look into a bedroom with its door open. Still no luck. You run to the other hall to see how Jane is doing, but she's nowhere in sight. You call out to her. You open every door that is not locked and look inside, but she does not answer. You walk back toward the stairs and jump with a start as a mouse runs past; then hurry on for a few steps...[/p]
        [p]Suddenly, standing before you, is a tall, elderly woman dressed in black, her hair swept back in a bun. Her burning green eyes seem to stare right through you.[/p]
        [p]So this is Mrs. Bigley! She never died after all. She looks like a witch! But of course witches don't really exist. Or do they?[/p]

        [p]You run back toward the kitchen door. As you go through the study, you see an old woman, dressed all in black. Her face is pale, and her reddish-white hair is swept back in a bun. So this is Mrs. Bigley! She looks so frightening, you would think she is a witch, if witches really existed.[/p]
        [p]“How nice it is to have visitors,” she says in a raspy voice. “You've been in the house quite a while, haven't you? I hardly knew where to find you; you've been running around as quietly as a mouse. Well, now that you're here, come with me to the pantry. I have some cheese and crackers I know you will like!”[/p]
        [p]“Thanks, but I'm very anxious to help my cousin Jane,” you say. “She's in the front hall. I'm afraid she is losing her mind. She thinks she is imprisoned by bars. But she really isn't.”[/p]
        [p]“Oh, I can take care of her. Don't worry,” Mrs. Bigley replies. “Just sit down and enjoy some cheese and crackers and I promise you I'll find Jane.”[/p]

        [p]You summon up your strength. Clinging rightly as you climb, you manage to pull yourself up to the second story balcony. You climb over the railing and step on to a small porch.[/p]
        [p]Looking through a window, you observe a mouse scurrying around on the bare wood floor.[/p]
        [p]You find the window unlocked. It opens easily and you could climb right in. Yet your hands feel clammy; your heart is pounding. As you lift the window open, you sense an evil presence within the room.[/p]

        [p]In a moment a heavyset man wearing a dirty plaid shirt opens the door. His face is pale and fat. His eyes are pink, like a pig's. Behind him is a huge dog – a mastiff – chained to a radiator. The dog growls menacingly, but does not move.[/p]
        [p]“What do you want?” Jervis asks gruffly.[/p]
        [p]“My cousin Jane is trapped in the house and I'm worried about her. Would you please unlock it and help me find her?”[/p]
        [p]“She should not be in there. Even I don't set foot in that house,” Jervis says.[/p]
        [p]“Why not?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“The mistress would put me away.”[/p]
        [p]“You mean you just take care of the grounds?”[/p]
        [p]“Aye, and bring them food and things.”[/p]
        [p]“But who takes care of the house?”[/p]
        [p]“It's taken care of all right, and so is anybody who goes inside. That's why I'll let you in, if you want.”[/p]

        [p]Cautiously, you retrace your steps to the storeroom closet, take the key ring, and return to the landing. At the top of one of the two flights of stairs leading upward, you make out the silhouette of a large black cat, its green eyes shining in the gloom of the hall.[/p]
        [p]Its back arched, its teeth bared, the cat hisses softly as you approach.[/p]

He is a large, heavy man and his square jaw and squinty eyes give him a sinister appearance. He surveys the room and his gaze rests upon you. It is Jervis, the caretaker.[/p]

You quickly climb out and find yourself looking into the burning, green eyes of a black cat – Melissa! Startled by your appearance, she arches her back and hisses, then leaps at you, claws extended. You reel back and she scampers off.[/p]
        [p]You follow her quickly through the kitchen and into the dining room where you lose sight of her. Then you hear the voice of an old woman calling, in a cackling voice, “Melissa, where are you?”[/p]

        [p]“You're a brave one, coming in here,” he says.[/p]
        [p]“So I've learned. I think someone drugged me,” you reply.[/p]
        [p]Jervis laughs menacingly. He holds his arm across the door, blocking you from getting past.[/p]
        [p]“Drugged, you say,” he says. “You'd be lucky if that's all it were.”[/p]
        [p]“What do you mean?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“You've not been drugged. You are [em]possessed[/em] – possessed by the cat devil. Your only chance is to stare down the cat till it gives in, or you will be cursed the rest of your life.”[/p]
        [p]“Why should I believe such a story?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“Can't you see,” Jervis says, pressing in so close that you take a step backward, “[em]I'm[/em] cursed.” Then in a calmer tone he says – “The maid you saw – [em]she's[/em] been cursed, too!”[/p]
        [p]Jervis talks so earnestly that you begin to think there could be something to what he says.[/p]

        [p]Figuring you can open the trap door easily enough later, you continue down into the basement of the house. The staircase is rickety; its wooden supports are rotted. Proceeding carefully, you reach the dirt floor of the basement. A little light comes in through several windows high above. The windows are slits, too narrow to climb through, even if you could reach them. Except for a few pieces of old furniture, a furnace, and overhead pipes and wires, the basement seems bare. Then from somewhere in the shadows, you hear the meowing of a cat.[/p]

For the first time, you notice a portrait on the wall of a tall slender woman, dressed in black and gray and holding a large black cat in her lap. As you walk toward the kitchen, you can't help keeping your eyes on the portrait, and the eyes in the portrait seem to follow you. The sensation it produces is so eerie and unpleasant you begin to feel ill.[/p]

        [p]With your eyes fixed upon the portrait, you reel against the sideboard. You put your hand out to balance yourself and knock over the green china cat. You watch it fly through the air and crash into dozens of pieces. Lena stands looking at you, speechless, her face white with horror.[/p]

        [p]You are curious to meet the mysterious Mrs. Bigley and dispel the myth about the curse. You get directions to the music room from Lena and find your way to the front hall and up the wide oak staircase to the second floor. From the upper hall you can hear the soft, plunking sounds of an old piano.[/p]

        [p]Relieved at Mrs. Bigley's words, you start down the stairs, thinking she will follow. After a few steps you glance back. She is gone. Confused, you continue on to the first floor and into the library. It looks as if you will have to search the house on your own.[/p]

        [p]“I'm sorry about that,” you reply, “but I'm trying to find my cousin Jane. Who are you?”[/p]
        [p]“My name is Lena. I am Mrs. Bigley's maid. Do you know that there is a policeman outside? I just saw him through the window. There is a boy with him. He'll be coming in the back door. I must let him in.”[/p]
        [p]“Yes, he'll help me find Jane,” you say.[/p]
        [p]“He will never be able to help you. You must stay out of sight. That is your only chance.”[/p]

        [p]You go into the pantry with Mrs. Bigley. Some crackers and cheese are already on the table. You decide to eat one cracker and no more. As soon as you take your first bite, you feel dizzy.[/p]
        [p]Your vision is blurred, but, as well as you can tell, everything around you looks as if it is growing in size. The fuzzy outline of Mrs. Bigley seems to tower above you. You wonder if you have been poisoned, but you can't think straight.[/p]
        [p]You jump down from your chair and run as fast as you can out of the dining room and into the study. You hear sounds behind you. Mrs. Bigley must be chasing you. You dare not look back. For an instant, you realize you should not be afraid of an old woman, but you [em]are[/em] afraid.[/p]
        [p]Ahead of you is a small passageway you didn't notice before. It looks almost like a tunnel – an escape route. You scamper inside. You have to crawl, but gradually it seems to get larger, much larger, so that you can almost stand up. Suddenly you realize that your surroundings have not been getting larger; you have been getting smaller – much, much smaller! You try to stand up, but you can't seem to keep your balance, [em]standing on your hind legs[/em] . You try to cry out, but your brain can only think – [em]run, eat, hide,[/em] – like the mouse you are.[/p]

For a brief moment, you see the image of a black cat in her eyes before they close as she collapses in a heap on the floor. You and Lena bend down and examine her. You lift her wrist to take her pulse, but she seems to be dead.[/p]
        [p]“You've saved me!” Lena cries. “But, we must get out of here. Follow me!”[/p]

        [p]You walk through the huge kitchen, kicking pieces of the broken tile floor aside, and then through the dining room, with its long oak table and high-backed chairs. You call for Jane as you walk into the elegantly-furnished library, where you see before you, standing in the middle of the oriental rug, a large black cat that stares up at you with intense, green eyes. It must be Melissa.[/p]
        [p]The cat starts pacing back and forth. It runs into the front hall and then comes back to the doorway and peers up at you as if it wants you to follow.[/p]

        [p]Then you hear a raspy voice calling, “Who are you? What do you mean breaking into my house?”[/p]
        [p]You vault into the room, open the door, and run to the hall. There you encounter a tall, elderly woman, who stands glaring at you with burning, green eyes – Mrs. Bigley! But, a moment later she seems to vanish right in front of you! Confused and upset, but determined to find Jane, you continue on into the darkened hallway. As you stop to let your eyes adjust, you hear a shaky, quivering voice calling in the darkness, again and again, “Help me. Set me free.”[/p]
        [p]You stand, frozen, listening, while the voice continues, “Walk toward me. Touch my hand. Free me!”[/p]
        [p]As you walk toward the voice, you feel as if you are walking in a fog. You can only see a few feet in front of you. Suddenly there appears before you an outstretched hand, pale white – its long bony fingers extended toward you.

Its shoulders are hunched and its head is low as it stalks the mouse. Then, angered by your intrusion, it leaps aside, arching its back and hissing at you.[/p]
        [p]The cat turns; you grab for it, and your hands come down on its tail. You hold it a moment, but it slips away and runs into an open cupboard. When you look in, you see it is actually a tiny passageway.[/p]
        [p]You run around the corner and down the hall. Ahead of you is an open bedroom door. You walk into it and are startled to see – lying on a rug – a thin, tall, elderly woman, dressed in a long black dress. Her hair is reddish-white, and her face is pale white. She is clutching at her chest with her thin bony hands. She stares at you with burning green eyes as you approach.[/p]
        [p]“I'm dying,” she cries. “It's too much for my heart. Too much ... but you will be next. I'll see to that!”[/p]

        [p]You call up to the cat, but it remains immobile, its eyes fixed upon you. You stare back. It returns your gaze without blinking, then arches its back, hisses, and runs off.[/p]
        [p]You follow it down a narrow corridor, but lose sight of it as it darts around a corner. Soon you come to a massive oak door. It is locked.[/p]
        [p]You try the keys on your key ring. One of them works! You pull open the door and shine your flashlight inside. There are steps leading down. Drawn by curiosity, you cautiously descend the stairs.[/p]
        [p]When you reach the bottom, you find yourself in an underground tunnel. Its floor is paved with cobblestones; the walls and ceiling are supported by wooden beams. The air is damp and cold. You follow the tunnel for about a hundred feet before it opens up into a wide space filled with casks and racks of bottles. This must be a special cave where Mr. Bigley kept his wines.[/p]
        [p]At the far end of the cave is a chest with three drawers. The top one is locked. You try another one of your keys. It works! You pull open the drawer and take out some yellowed, crumbling papers you find there. Among them is a letter, written in a shaky hand, which reads:[/p]
        [p class="handwritten"]To Whom It May Concern[/p]
        [p class="handwritten"]I, Horace A. Bigley, am a prisoner in my own house, held by the ghost of my wife. Melissa Bigley, who died one month ago today, and now has the power to transform people into...[/p]

It may be of no use against a ghost, but it is your only weapon.[/p]

        [p]You start down the stairs toward the kitchen, keeping an eye in the direction of the cat. You reach a landing and start to walk along a passageway leading off from it.[/p]
        [p]You are wondering whether to continue on, when you hear a muffled voice calling, “Melissa, where are you? Melissa, where are you?”[/p]
        [p]Could this be Mrs. Bigley?[/p]
        [p]As you cautiously walk along the passageway, you hear the voice speaking again – “It's time for me to come to you, Melissa.”[/p]
        [p]You round the corner and encounter a slim, tall, elderly woman dressed in black. Her face is wrinkled, but her green eyes are sharp. Her nose seems darker than the rest of her face. Her head slopes back, and her reddish-white hair is swept back in a bun. She stares at you with hatred in her eyes, and you stare back, determined not to turn your eyes away. Suddenly, she shrieks and runs down the stairs.[/p]
        [p]You follow her down the stairs and stumble through the kitchen and out into the yard. You sit down at the base of a large tree, trying to sort out your thoughts.[/p]
        [p]In a few minutes, Jane and Michael join you. They tell you they searched the house but could not find Mrs. Bigley or her cat.[/p]
        [p]The next morning, your visit with Jane and Michael is at an end. You have an hour or so before your bus leaves. You walk up the road again to Chimney Rock and stand looking at it for a long time. Then you see the burly, fat-faced caretaker approaching you, his huge dog with him, straining at the leash.[/p]
        [p]As he approaches, you get ready to run, but he calls out, “Don't be afraid. I am your friend. You have freed me from the witch's curse!”[/p]
        [p]“What do you mean? Where is Mrs. Bigley?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“She died, yesterday,” he replies, “for the last time.”[/p]

        [p]You follow Lena upstairs and through the upper hall to a room in the back of the house. The room contains a sewing machine, a loom and a table. There is also an armchair with a flower-print slip cover. On it, sound asleep, is a large black cat.[/p]
        [p]You pick up the cat and walk swiftly down the steps through the interior rooms and out the kitchen door. The cat tries to scratch you and jump out of your arms, but you hold it tightly. Lena throws open the door, and you step outside into the bright sunlight. The cat begins to purr.[/p]

        [p]Michael and Jane come running up. They are surprised to see you with Lena and the cat. No one notices the heavyset man walking toward you until he is almost upon you. It is Jervis, the caretaker. Everyone looks at him anxiously, but he smiles broadly.[/p]

        [p]You enter the room and walk toward Melissa. She continues to stare at you intently, as if she could read your mind. She is clearly not an ordinary cat; she seems like a creature in a dream.[/p]
        [p]As you get closer to her, she opens her mouth, as if to laugh. Suddenly, she leaps off the piano and patters toward the door you just entered. She stops and stares intently at you again, as if daring you to pick her up.[/p]

        [p]You walk back toward the stairs and turn down another hall leading to some bedrooms, the furthest of which may connect to the music room. At the end of the hall is a large mirror in an ornate gold frame. As you approach it, you see your own reflection and, behind it, the silhouette of a tall, elderly woman dressed in black. Even in the dim light, you can see her burning, green eyes fixed on you. They seem to pin you to your place with a power so strong that you cannot move. You stand helplessly as she walks toward you. You know you must force yourself to act.[/p]

        [p]The policeman pauses in the entryway near the back door and glances around. He opens a cupboard door as if to inspect it. He stands transfixed, staring into the cupboard. For a moment he opens his mouth, as if to scream, but no sound emerges. Then he staggers backward, turns and runs from the house.[/p]

        [p]“I'm glad you're here,” you cry out. “We need help. Jane is missing!”[/p]
        [p]The policeman seems to be looking beyond you. You turn and see Mrs. Bigley glaring at you.[/p]
        [p]“How lovely to have so many guests,” she says in a phony, sweet voice.[/p]
        [p]“Yes, but where is Jane?” you ask. “I've looked everywhere upstairs and I can't find her.”[/p]
        [p]“She must have gone outside for some fresh air,” Mrs. Bigley says sweetly.[/p]
        [p]You do not trust Mrs. Bigley, and you ask the policeman to search upstairs. He obliges you, scurrying everywhere, calling for Jane in a bellowing voice, but without success. By the time he rejoins you, he is angry.[/p]
        [p]“I'm sure Jane left, and I'm leaving too,” he says, as he hurries for the door. Is he leaving in a rush because he is afraid of the curse?[/p]

        [p]Somehow you feel the policeman will be no match for Mrs. Bigley. You head upstairs, determined to look in every room and closet in the house, if necessary, to find Jane.[/p]
        [p]At the top of the stairs, you hear a tinkly musical sound coming from a room down the hall. You walk very quietly to the door, which is slightly ajar, in time to see a large black cat jump down from the keys of a piano. So this is Melissa! The cat runs toward you. As it comes out the door you pick it up and hold it tightly.[/p]
        [p]“I know you can help me find Jane,” you say impulsively.[/p]
        [p]You don't quite know why you say these words, but somehow you feel that the cat understands. You take off your belt and make a leash out of it. The cat squirms. It looks up at you with hatred in its eyes. Holding the end of your belt tightly, you drop the cat on the floor.[/p]
        [p]“Take me to Jane,” you say.[/p]
        [p]The cat starts rapidly down the hall and then turns into a long corridor leading to another wing of the house as if it knows exactly where it is going.[/p]
        [p]Finally, it stops in front of a closed door. You turn the handle of the door. It is unlocked. You slowly open the door and look into a small bedroom. It obviously has not been used for a long time. The shade has fallen from the window, and paint is peeling off the walls. The room is empty except for an old-fashioned brass bed frame. Cringing in a corner, shivering, with no place to run or hide, is a mouse, which looks up at you helplessly.[/p]

You feel as though you must get away from the cat, and you drop the leash and run from the room, slamming the door behind you. You run down the stairs, where you find Lena, trembling with fear.[/p]
        [p]“Where are Michael and the policeman?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“I... I don't know,” she replies softly. “They disappeared. I can't say where, or it will be the end of me.”[/p]
        [p]She collapses into a chair and begins to cry uncontrollably. You want to comfort her, but you are angry that you let the cat go. Then, suddenly, you see it again, moving slowly toward you.[/p]

        [p]In the middle of the room is a grand piano, made of ebony and inlaid with gold. A large, black cat is walking back and forth on the keys. It must be Melissa.[/p]
        [p]Sensing your presence, the cat stops and stares intently at the crack in the door. You cannot be sure whether or not it knows you are watching it.[/p]

        [p]“I found her, all right,” he says. “But she's no longer alive – a heart attack, I would say. The poor old woman has fallen victim to the curse of Chimney Rock.”[/p]
        [p]“No, officer, you don't understand,” Lena says. “Mrs. Bigley was a witch. Only her death could end the curse!”[/p]

        [p]You look around and see an old woman with a cane standing nearby. She is slim, like Lena, though much older and much taller. She is slightly stooped, and her head swings around like the head of a snake. Her sharp, green eyes fix on you and then on Lena, who seems to shrivel under the force of her mistress' gaze.

        [p]There is a door near the top of the stairs. The cat runs through it, and you follow. By the light coming through a high, triangular window under the peak of the gable, you can see a human figure huddled in the corner. It is Jane! As you run toward her, the door shuts behind you, and you hear a latch click. You try to pull it open, but it is locked![/p]
        [p]You look around for the cat. It is gone. You bend over Jane, who is crying.[/p]
        [p]Is the cat trained to do this trick? You are certain that you and Jane are both in danger. You cry out, but there is no answer.[/p]

        [p]At that moment, a police car roars up the drive. Michael and a policeman jump out. The dog backs off and starts barking at the policeman, who takes out his gun and fires a shot in the air. Jervis, the caretaker, comes running up. When he spots the policeman, he calls off his dog.[/p]
        [p]Suddenly, you hear a crash. Jane has broken a window in the living room. She jumps out into a juniper bush.[/p]

You three should never have come into this house. You probably frightened her so much that it brought on a heart attack. I should have you booked on half a dozen counts, but I think you've all learned your lesson.”[/p]
        [p]Jane says she feels ill. and the policeman drives her home. She recovers in a few days, but she is unable to remember what happened to her in Chimney Rock.[/p]

        [p]Michael and Jane come running up. Michael rips off his shirt and bandages your arm. They help you back to their house and call an ambulance to take you to the hospital.[/p]
        [p]Later, standing at your bedside, your doctor says – “You will always have a scar by which to remember the curse of Chimney Rock.”[/p]

        [p]As you pass through the library in your search for Jane, you are surprised to feel a cold draft of air coming from the great stone fireplace. With its opening framed by huge rough stones, it looks like the entrance to a cavern. You walk up close and stare into the cold, black depths of the great chimney. You are about to turn away when you are startled by a long low moaning sound. Is it just the wind or is it a human cry? Could it be Jane, somehow trapped inside? You crouch and crane your neck to see. The air feels cold and damp. You shiver a moment, and at that moment a hand clutches your shoulder from behind. You whirl around to face your attacker; but it is Jane![/p]
        [p]“I couldn't find you,” she says. “Why, you are shivering! It's so cold here. Let's get out.”[/p]
        [p]In a few moments you and Jane are safely outside in the warm sunlight. Michael is waiting to greet you. Your visit with them lasts longer than you expected, because you have to spend the next week in bed with pneumonia.[/p]
        [p]“If it weren't for antibiotics,” your doctor tells you, “you would be remembered in this town as another victim of the curse of Chimney Rock.”[/p]

        [p]You walk up to the cupboard and fling open the door. On the shelf in front of your eyes is a stuffed mouse, surrounded by twigs and leaves as if in its natural setting. The mouse is standing with one tiny paw resting on a piece of bark. Your mouth falls open in disbelief when you read the brass plaque next to the mouse on which is inscribed [em]Horace I. Bigley (1921 – 1979)[/em] .[/p]
        [p]Bewildered and confused, you stagger out of Chimney Rock. A few minutes later, two more policemen arrive. They search the house, but they are unable to find Jane. You have a sinking feeling you may never see her again.[/p]

        [p]You climb the main staircase. After exploring the hallways, you find the spiral stairs leading up to the tower. You run up, whirling around and around the center pole so fast that you are almost dizzy by the time you reach the top of the tower – a small, square room with large windows on each side. You have a fine view of the grounds, the road and the surrounding countryside.[/p]
        [p]There is no sign of Jane, but you watch with interest as a police car pulls up next to the one already there. A moment later, you see Jane, Michael, and the first policeman running. Even from the tower, you can see they are very agitated. Jane stumbles, and the policeman helps her into the car. Michael stands, looking up at the house, a blank look on his face. Then the second policeman guides Michael into the car, and they drive away.[/p]
        [p]You are glad your friends are safe, but you are frightened. You want to leave Chimney Rock as quickly as possible. As you start climbing down the spiral staircase, you hear the meowing of a cat, at first distant, then closer, coming up the stairs.[/p]

        [p]You hurriedly climb the two flights of stairs to the attic. It is empty except for a large cardboard box containing a few old books and letters. One book strikes your eye. It is titled [em]The Curse of Chimney Rock[/em] .[/p]
        [p]You open it and start to read. The book starts by explaining that the first owner, Elizabeth Bigley, was struck by lightning. Her son, Charles Bigley, was killed when he fell off the roof. His daughter, Melissa, “mysteriously disappeared.”[/p]
        [p]You look up from the book for a moment, wondering what happens to people who “mysteriously disappear.” Suddenly you sense that the whole attic and everything in it is growing much larger, but in an instant you realize that it is you who are shrinking. You are dimly aware that no one will ever see you again.[/p]

        [p]“You don't mean that she can change into a cat?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“Let's just say that Mrs. Bigley leads a double life. You see – she is a witch,” Mrs. Krim replies.[/p]
        [p]“A witch!” you exclaim.[/p]
        [p]She beckons you closer.[/p]
        [p]“You are young,” she says, “and I am old. You must understand that there are things that people don't talk about, so you never learn about them except through experience – sometimes horrible experience.”[/p]
        [p]“What do you mean?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]Mrs. Krim fixes her steely, gray eyes on you and waits for you to meet her gaze before continuing.[/p]
        [p]“When my sister was a little girl, she wanted to be a cat. She had a cat of her own, and she named the cat Melissa – after herself! After the cat died, my sister missed her so much that she would often pretend that [em]she[/em] was the cat. Gradually, my sister's personality changed. She began to act more and more like a cat – and even to look like a cat. Then, one day...”[/p]

        [p]“Run to the window and jump!” she cries. “Jump for your life!”[/p]
        [p]You have no time to think. You throw open the window and jump, landing on the ground with a terrible thud. A shooting, stabbing pain flashes through your left arm. Michael and a policeman come running up.[/p]

Finally, you hear an answering voice that sounds almost next to you and yet far away at the same time. You grope around and feel a metal surface. You realize you are holding on to the end of a coal chute.[/p]
        [p]“Help!” you yell up the chute. In a moment, a voice answers. It's Michael! You take hold of the chute and work your way in. You find you can climb it. At the top is a thin wooden door. You push it open and climb into a back entryway to the house.[/p]
        [p]“I'm glad [em]you're[/em] not a ghost!” Michael says when he sees you.[/p]

        [p]Just as you are about to escape outside, you feel yourself being pulled slowly back as if by some invisible hand. What power can it be that has stopped you in your tracks? You turn and look into a pair of ghostly eyes surrounded by a round gray glow. From its mouthless form you hear this command: “[em]Leave at once. If ever again you look at Chimney Rock, my fate will be your fate.[/em] ”[/p]

I have been following the instructions in Mrs. Bigley's will. But there is another reward Jervis doesn't know about: Mrs. Bigley's will also provides that if the cat chooses a new owner, [em]who is willing to take the cat[/em], then that person will become the owner of the cat – and of Chimney Rock.”[/p]
        [p]“By the way, you may not realize it,” Mr. Prem continues, “but now that the curse is ended, Chimney Rock is worth a quarter of a million dollars!”[/p]
