        [p]You are an underwater explorer. In the deepest ocean, you have accidentally been shut out of your special underwater vessel! Luckily you have friends above you in a boat. But can they save you in time? As they begin pulling you up, you get dizzy and your arms and legs start to feel weak… you are exhausted! Then you see a dolphin heading toward you. You know that these marvelous mammals sometimes help people in trouble.[/p] 
        [p] What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices [em]you[/em] make. How does the story end? Only [em]you[/em] can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not [em]one[/em], but many incredibly daring experiences![/p][/p]

        [p]You are an underwater explorer. You are leaving to explore the deepest oceans. You must find the lost city of Atlantis. This is your most challenging assignment.[/p] 
        [p]It is morning and the sun pushes up on the horizon. The sea is calm. You climb into the narrow pilot's compartment of the underwater vessel [em]Seeker[/em] with your special gear. The crew of the research vessel [em]Maray[/em] screws down the hatch clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of the ocean. The [em]Seeker[/em] crew begins lowering by a strong, but thin cable. Within minutes, you are so deep in the ocean that little light filters down to you. The silence is eerie as the [em]Seeker[/em] slips deeper and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole and see fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to look at you - an intruder from another world.[/p] 
        [p]Now the cable attaching you to [em]Maray[/em] is extended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis.[/p] 
        [p]You have a special sea suit that will protect you from the intense pressure of the deep if you choose to walk about on the sea bottom. You can cut loose from the cable if you wish because the [em]Seeker[/em] is self-propelled. You are now in another world.[/p]

        [p]You radio a status report to the [em]Maray[/em] and tell them that you are going to cast off from the line and descend under your own power. Your plan is approved and you cast off your line. Now you are on your own. The [em]Seeker[/em] slips noiselessly into the undersea canyon.[/p] 
        [p]As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the [em]Seeker[/em]'s powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle growth. To the left (port) side you see what appears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly round, as if it had been cut by human hands.[/p] 
        [p]Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the right (starboard) side of the [em]Seeker[/em] you see bubbles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.[/p]

    <text>
        [p]Your sea suit will protect you from the intense pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the airlock of the [em]Seeker[/em] and stand on the ocean floor. It is a strange and marvelous world where your every move is slowed down. You begin to explore with your special hand-held searchlight. You examine the ledge by the canyon.[/p] 
        [p]Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish dart by, almost brushing you. What made them move so fast? Are they being chased?[/p] 
        [p]Then you see it. The [em]Seeker[/em] is in the grips of a huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long, powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock formation. You know the spear gun you carry will be useless against this monster. It looks as though it will destroy the [em]Seeker[/em]. Fish of all sizes huddle with you in an attempt to escape the monster.[/p]

        [p]Carefully, you maneuver the [em]Seeker[/em] between the walls of the canyon.[/p] 
        [p]On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large round hole out of which flow the large bubbles. The [em]Seeker[/em] is equipped with scientific equipment to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equipment that can measure the depth of any hole.[/p]

        [p]You pilot the [em]Seeker[/em] through the rounded entrance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight picks up what appear to be docks and piers along the grotto walls. The [em]Seeker[/em]'s searchlight is not very powerful. However, you do have a special laser light which would light up the grotto like daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be used twice for very short periods before it must be recharged aboard the [em]Maray[/em], now more than 2,000 feet above you on the surface.[/p]

        [p]The giant squid tosses and turns the [em]Seeker[/em], but finally the creature grows tired of its new game and jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now are free to leave your hiding place and examine the [em]Seeker[/em] for damage.[/p] 
        [p]To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been jammed shut. You are locked out of the [em]Seeker[/em]. The crew of the [em]Maray[/em], however, suspected trouble when you did not respond to a routine radio check and they are now lowering an escape platform to you. Once on the platform, you radio them to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the bends - rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in your blood - they will have to bring you up very slowly.[/p] 
        [p]Just as the platform begins to move, the giant squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is headed directly at you.[/p]

        [p]You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the [em]Seeker[/em], you use special equipment to analyze the bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against the valve that dumps the compressed air necessary to make the [em]Seeker[/em] rise to the surface. There is nothing to be done about it; so you continue to analyze the bubbles. They contain a high percentage of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps they are coming from some area below the sea where human-type beings can live and breathe. Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis.[/p] 
        [p]You wonder whether you should try the [em]Seeker[/em]'s drilling arm to enlarge the source of the bubbles so you can explore it with the [em]Seeker[/em]. But you are also very worried about the [em]Seeker[/em]'s loss of rising capability. You might also be able to trap the bubbles and use them to raise the [em]Seeker[/em].[/p]

        [p]Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave the [em]Seeker[/em] in the grips of the giant squid. Your plan is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in the water. The crewmen above have been instructed to watch for such emergency signals. They will send help.[/p] 
        [p]Once you reach the ledge above the canyon and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all sea creatures - a huge shark. It begins to circle towards you and you know that you are its target. You wonder whether you should fire your emergency propulsion charge that will send you rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might catch you anyway. You also know that you will get the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.[/p]

        [p]You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems to slope upward and you follow the slope. The depth finder shows that you are rising quite rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and open air. Then the roof of the grotto stops sloping upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic hatch made of a metal that you have never seen before. With the mechanical arm of the [em]Seeker[/em] you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to make contact on the other side.[/p]

        [p]You maneuver the [em]Seeker[/em] next to the hole and begin to take sonar readings to determine the depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily deep - it might reach the center of the earth![/p] 
        [p]What lies down there? Where are the bubbles coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?[/p] 
        [p]Then you notice a disturbing reading on your instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The [em]Seeker[/em] is not damaged, but the earthquake could set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the [em]Maray[/em] to leave for safer areas. It might be dangerous not to get back to the surface and leave with the [em]Maray[/em]. On the other hand, you are perhaps on the verge of one of the world's greatest discoveries.[/p]

        [p]The beam from the laser light illuminates the entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a submarine! Cautiously, you maneuver the [em]Seeker[/em] closer. You identify it as the submarine that mysteriously disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle almost a year before. The Bermuda Triangle is more than 2000 miles away.[/p] 
        [p]The submarine is apparently not damaged, but it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim around it as though it is their own special prize. Then you notice that the main hatch is free of algae![/p]

        [p]With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you. Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears. They strike the squid close to its two monstrous eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.[/p] 
        [p]One of the tentacles wraps around your diving helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into your suit. You signal the [em]Maray[/em] to haul you up fast - "Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You think you're about to black out.[/p] 
        [p]You wake up on the deck of the [em]Maray[/em] and are quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you are better and start to worry about diving into the abyss again.[/p]

The world seems upside down. The shark is nowhere around, you hope. Then you break through to the surface floating about a half mile from the [em]Maray[/em].[/p] 
        [p]The lookouts spot you in the water and quickly rescue you. Unfortunately, the rapid ascent has given you a bad case of the bends. It takes a long time to decompress.

        [p]As you begin to drill, the stream of bubbles increases.[/p] 
        [p]The stream of bubbles is strong enough now to ruffle the surface of the sea. You could try to surface now and locate the exact position of the bubble area. Then you could make plans with the scientists aboard the [em]Maray[/em] about what to do next. But also, you could simply explore the hole with the [em]Seeker[/em] to determine the source of the bubbles now! There is great risk in entering the hole, but it could lead to the source of the bubbles and maybe to Atlantis.[/p]

        [p]Now is the time for decision. You check all the controls of the [em]Seeker[/em], grit your teeth, and push the control column into the deep dive position. Down, down you go where no person has ever ventured. The [em]Seeker[/em] is built for deep, deep dives, but you are descending rapidly mile after mile into the deep. The pressure is intense, the darkness is complete, and the depth guage indicates an incredible 15 miles. You quickly reverse the control column. Warning lights flare up on your control panel; they show that gravitational forces are now stronger than the [em]Seeker[/em]'s propulsion motors. You have passed the point of no return and your journey downward will continue in utter darkness until the water pressure is too great for the [em]Seeker[/em]. This is the final voyage. [/p]

        [p]You are able to capture the bubbling gases and fill the tanks of the [em]Seeker[/em], enough to allow it to rise. Slowly, the [em]Seeker[/em] rises out of the canyon, scattering schools of brightly colored fish, and brushing past underwater plants that wave like palm trees in a wind. Just as you reach the ledge at the top of the canyon, you see what appears to be an old road! Rocks along its side seem to be guard rails. Could this be a path that leads to the lost city of Atlantis? You anchor the [em]Seeker[/em] and prepare to investigate more closely.[/p]

Pushing the fire button, you send a powerful beam at the hatch. Nothing happens. Then you advance the cannon control to full emergency force. Again you push the button and the beam dissolves the hatch instantly. A flood of sea water rushes into the giant hole, carrying you with it into an air-filled cavern beyond. The water fills the cavern with speed and explosive force. You see several people scurrying towards escape hatches. IT IS TOO LATE! You did the wrong thing. [/p]

        [p]Deciding to return to the surface, you direct the [em]Seeker[/em] cautiously back along the side of the canyon in the ocean floor. Without warning, the [em]Seeker[/em] is gripped in a powerful current that sweeps it toward a grotto. Once in the grotto, the current carries you to what appears to be a large metal door. It swings open and the [em]Seeker[/em] is swept inside. The door closes, the water in the grotto drains away, and you step out into a chamber that you decide must be made by human hands.[/p] 
        [p]A door opens in the wall, two people dressed in simple clothes come towards you. One of them says, “Welcome to Atlantis. We have been expecting you.”[/p] 
        [p]What a discovery! You have found the lost continent and its civilization. The two people tell you that although citizens of Atlantis occasionally journey to the upper world, anyone who happens upon Atlantis is never permitted to leave. The Atlanteans are not cruel but fear discovery of their world.[/p] 
        [p]They want you to follow them and you [em]agree[/em]. But you have another thought. Perhaps you could blast your way out of the chamber with the [em]Seeker[/em]'s laser cannon.[/p]

There are no signs of life, but there are also no signs of struggle or trouble. In the control room, you see a piece of mystifying equipment that just doesn't belong on this sub.[/p] 
        [p]A voice begins telling you that, thousands of years ago, the leaders of Atlantis realized that their continent was slipping into the sea. They discovered a large underground cavern and built new forms of living quarters for their people. Later when Atlantis was deep beneath the ocean, some of their scientists discovered and perfected an operation enabling them to breathe under water.[/p] 
        [p]The voice, which sounds friendly, also tells you that there are two groups in Atlantis. One group is good and the other is evil. The voice invites you to enter the world of Atlantis and gives directions and instructions to a secret passageway to the underwater city.[/p]

Maybe people from Atlantis capture ships in the Bermuda Triangle and bring them here. Then you see another ship, but this one is a three-masted schooner of the type used in the early 1800s. Its rigging is festooned with algae, and fish swim lazily around its mast.[/p] 
        [p]Your curiosity captures you and you put on your sea suit. Leaving the [em]Seeker[/em], you move towards the old sailing ship.

        [p]You suddenly realize the stream of bubbles is powerful enough to raise the [em]Seeker[/em]. You guide the [em]Seeker[/em] into the bubble stream and it heads towards the surface. As you swirl upward, you begin to notice increasing amounts of brown kelp - seaweed. Near the surface, you become entangled in the seaweed. The instruments in the [em]Seeker [/em]indicate that the propellers and the steering mechanisms will not work.[/p] 
        [p]You put on your sea suit and go out to see what can be done. Once outside in the kelp, you realize that you can't free the [em]Seeker[/em]. You start to swim for the surface but then you are soon completely stuck in the clinging seaweed. You are trapped and unable to go forward or return to the [em]Seeker[/em].[/p]

        [p]Then a large fish - ugly, lumpy, puffed up, and covered with black and white markings swims towards you. Its bulging eyes fasten on you. It is a [em]big-mouthed grouper[/em], a fish which does not bother to bite its victims, but simply swallows them whole.[/p]

        [p]“Welcome to Atlantis. Thousands of years ago we learned that we were about to slip into the sea. Our people prepared for the calamity by building a new city inside an extinct volcano. We have lived here in peace and harmony ever since. We have no sunlight, nor stars to gaze at, but we have other spaces to meditate upon.”[/p] 
        [p]She tells you about a group of people called the Nodoors. If you wish, you can live with them, but you cannot leave Atlantis.[/p] 
        [p]A bearded man is to be your escort. Atlantis is a beautiful city. Buildings merge one into another, colors radiate light, and coral branches fill courtyards. There is a sense of well-being and peace.[/p] 
        [p]It would be pleasant here, but you don't want to be a prisoner. Maybe there would be a better chance to escape if you join the Nodoors. You ask your guide about them.[/p]

Their civilization is technologically very advanced and a sensing mechanism tells them that you are about to use your laser cannon. They quickly fire a special beam at the [em]Seeker[/em] that makes all its functions stop. You are now powerless to escape. They walk up calmly to the [em]Seeker[/em] and tell you to come with them to Atlantis.[/p]

        [p]The land is pleasant, although strange to your experience. A soft substance covers the ground. It seems to be alive. You can't tell. A gentle light comes from the sides of this huge cavern. It reminds you of early morning light just before the sun rises.[/p] 
        [p]A group of people approach you with friendly gestures. They are wearing simple clothes much like the clothes people wore in ancient Greece. They are kind and generous. You remove your diving suit to find that the air is good to breathe.[/p] 
        [p]These people speak a language that is unknown to you, but one of them acts as an interpreter. You find out that this is Atlantis.

        [p]A door leads to a smaller cabin. On a table near the rear of this cabin is a golden box. You open it and find the remains of a map. It does not show Atlantis. It shows that the ship was searching for a hole that leads to the center of the earth![/p] 
        [p]You return to the [em]Seeker[/em] and use the map to locate this incredible shaft to the center of the earth.

Then the [em]Seeker[/em]'s engine stops and you are pulled along through the semi-liquid material by something like gravity or magnetism. You burst through a thick elastic membrane and enter an area of giant atoms. Electrons whirl around you at high speed, but there is plenty of room to maneuver between these fast-moving particles.

The monitors aboard the [em]Maray[/em] are damaged by a frightful electric storm discharge. You are all alive but there are no funds to replace the damaged equipment. The expedition to Atlantis is over. [/p]

You leave the [em]Seeker[/em], swim to the whale, and grab its fluke. With a smooth powerful movement, the giant mammal begins to swim to the surface. You have trouble holding on. Then the whale breaks the surface and lies there filling its lungs with air. You quietly swim away.[/p]

As you move your head slowly inside your helmet, you feel an intense pain shooting across your right temple. You have to lie very still then and gradually your ears pick up the thrum of the search helicopter. You don't dare move to look, but as the minutes go by, the thrum gets louder and slowly disappears.

You fall back onto the surface of the ocean close to the [em]Maray[/em]. Although you are stunned by the fall, you quickly gain your senses and are picked up by the ship.

The Atlanteans are interested in all aspects of earth life: the technology, politics, wars, and religion.[/p] 
        [p]You ask them why, but they never give you a direct answer. Then one day you look down at yourself and you only see bright, glowing energy. With horror you realize you have become one of them. [/p]

        [p]You are in the Atlantean world; why not become like an Atlantean? Looking down at your hands, you see them gradually begin to glow with a warm, yellow light. Little by little, the glow travels up your arms and legs until suddenly you have no body left. You are a glowing energy form. You feel a sense of freedom and happiness that you have never known before. You can float, or fly, or zoom anywhere you want to. No walls stop you; you just melt through them. You don't need food or rest. You can travel through time, and you can travel instantly back to earth in your energy form.[/p] 
        [p]You feel that this is the way you want to be.[/p]

        [p]Farming under the sea is a job that you enjoy. Outside Atlantis, there are fields of sea plants that are worked on just like gardens above the sea. Atlanteans go out each day and harvest the plants, take care of the fields, and chase away the fish that love to nibble on the growing plants. Then there are fish pens to work on. There you feed and tend the fish until they are needed for food. Farming under the sea is beautiful and it is much easier than you had imagined. Danger lurks, though, in the form of sting rays, slender sea snakes, and occasional sharks. You have to be on your guard at all times.[/p]

        [p]A musician in the world of Atlantis. Who would believe it? You are asked to choose an instrument to play. You examine water lutes, sea drums, shark bone flutes, and a wide range of electronic instruments. You choose one of the electronic instruments, but it makes no sound at all. You are told that it plays music that people feel rather than hear. What a world you're living in! Who would believe in music that is not heard? Gradually you learn to feel the different notes with parts of your body: your thighs, chest, temples, and fingertips. Your interest in this new way of sensing music grows with each day. You master this new art form. You become their greatest musician.[/p]

        [p]These people lead you to a control room. There you meet the commander of an underwater scientific center that is conducting secret research into life underneath the sea. They inform you that it was a good thing that you did not use your laser cannon, because they have anti-laser devices that would have blown you and the [em]Seeker[/em] to pieces.[/p] 
        [p]After a pleasant meal and a tour of the deepwater lab, you are sent back to the [em]Seeker[/em] for a return journey to the surface. You are told never to return again; if you do, you will be kept a prisoner for the rest of your life.[/p]

        [p]When you refuse to follow them, they take out small hand-held hypnotizers that put you into a deep trance. You are led through a long tunnel into a large underwater lab. Three military technicians come up to you and break the trance.[/p] 
        [p]“You have stumbled into a secret military base. We're developing too many secret plans to risk being discovered. You will remain our prisoner.”[/p] 
        [p]There is no escape.[/p]

        [p]You argue with yourself for weeks. Then you decide to go back to Atlantis. You are in such a hurry to return that you hire a small, fast hydrofoil craft to take you to the spot in the ocean where Atlantis is. Once reaching the spot, you intend to make a dive with just scuba gear! You know a 2000 foot dive is impossible. But you don't care; you feel you must make the attempt.[/p] 
        [p]A storm rips the sea for six days and when it clears you prepare to dive. Just as you slip into the water, you look up into the sky and high above the clouds you see the sparkling city of Atlantis. No dive is necessary.[/p]

        [p]During the night, you are awakened by the sound of voices talking quietly. Listening, you realize that a group of Nodoors is planning an escape. They want to join the Atlanteans. They believe that life in Atlantis can be better for them. You join them and listen to the stories of fear and darkness. They seek light and friendship. It sounds simple, but nothing is easy.[/p] 
        [p class="inlineImage"][img src="resources/cyoa2/108.jpg" /][/p] 
        [p]Suddenly the door bursts open. Three guards armed with special weapons rush in. They fire the weapons and in a flash of brilliant light you and your companions are vaporized.[/p]

        [p]Over 1000 years of thought travel later, you are called into the main thinking room. You are told that you may now return to earth life. You have doubts about going back, but you are curious to see what changes have occurred while you were living in Atlantis.[/p] 
        [p]What a sight greets you as you circle earth at an altitude of 1000 feet! The great cities of the world, New York, London, Paris, and Hong Kong are overgrown with vegetation. The roads leading into the cities are barely visible. But you see signs of new settlements. There are clusters of buildings spread out in the countryside. You don't see any smokestacks. There are few roads and no cars. The people live a simple life providing themselves with food, shelter, and clothing. You wish to join them.[/p]

        [p]Years ago the Atlanteans had worked out emergency procedures, but most people had forgotten them. One old person remembers where the emergency instructions and equipment were kept.[/p] 
        [p]You and the Atlanteans work without stop for 72 hours pumping out the flooding waters and building a special retaining wall around the volcanic crack. Finally the last pump is shut off. You are all exhausted, but you've won in your battle against the sea.[/p]

        [p]With everyone worried about the sea crashing in, no one will notice you if you try to escape. You run down a long, little-used corridor that leads to the sea. The exit door is heavy and rusty from not being used. You push with all your might, and finally it swings open into an airlock to the open water. You push the emergency release button and shoot out into the water. The [em]Seeker[/em] is where you left it, and once inside, you head for the surface where the [em]Maray[/em] waits for you.[/p]

        [p]It is useless to try to escape the soldiers. You are surrounded. They take you to the king, and he sadly tells you that you are just like all the rest. He can't trust anyone. He will have to decide what to do with you and in the meantime he throws you into the dungeon.[/p]

        [p]How can you escape? The soldiers are coming after you. You yell as loud as you can and everyone in the theater surrounds you, forming a barrier to the soldiers. The soldiers stare at the people all around them, hesitate, and then quickly leave. They know that the odds are too great to win such a fight.[/p] 
        [p]The people cry for the revolt to go on. The crowd leaves the theater and heads to the king's quarters. All along the route people join you and even the king's soldiers begin to join the crowd. You and the people are free; the king is put in prison. The revolt is a success.[/p]
