        [p]You were born on a spaceship traveling between galaxies. An experienced intergalactic adventurer, you are now on a mission to a distant planet. Suddenly on your screen you see an alien spacecraft – like nothing you've ever seen before. Will the aliens be hostile or friendly? There isn't much time. Should you fight and hope to drive them off, or just go quietly with them? Here they come![/p]
        [p]What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices [em]you[/em] make. How does the story end? Only [em]you[/em] can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not [em]one[/em], but [em]many[/em] incredibly daring experiences![/p]

        [p]You are born on a spaceship traveling between galaxies. The spaceship is on a research mission. The crew of the spaceship includes people from five different galaxies. Your parents are not from the same galaxy, but both have features common to those found on the planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy.[/p]
        [p]Because you have been born in space you may choose which galaxy and planet you wish to belong to and have citizenship in.[/p]
        [p]Because the spaceship is traveling at a very great speed, you reach the earth-age of 18 years old in just three days and two hours. Now you must choose the planet Phonon in the galaxy of PINEUM or the planet Zermacroyd in the galaxy of OOPHOSS.[/p]
        [p]Phonon is three times the size of the planet Earth. The star that provides some of its life-giving force is huge but ancient. There is fear that it is losing its force. Phonon has a history filled with trouble.[/p]
        [p]Zermacroyd is in the galaxy OOPHOSS far distant from the Milky Way galaxy. This galaxy has black holes and supernova stars. It has always been regarded as an uncertain region by observers and spacecraft crews. It is a difficult area and the black holes are unplotted and dangerous. Reports from previous space probes say that Zermacroyd has had a dim and troubled past. The reports also prophesied a bright and exciting future.[/p]

        [p class="inlineImage"][img src="resources/cyoa4/2.jpg" /][/p]
        [p]Phonon is visible on the galaxy scanner. Now that you have chosen, your parents announce that Phonon is your father's home. The crew of the spaceship carefully prepares a spacepod for the journey to Phonon. You seat yourself at the controls and position the programmed flight path, disengage from the mother ship and drift off into space. Once in space you are propelled by gravity generators.[/p]
        [p]Something is wrong! You look at the scanner and see a nebula that is not supposed to be on your course. Suddenly the gases and particles of the nebula surround you. Your gravity generators and life-support systems might fail. The radiation counter interrupts the silence of space flight with harsh bleeps and crackles a warning of dangerous radiation levels.[/p]

    <text>
        [p]Zermacroyd! What a name. You can't resist this planet and its unknown past. When the captain mentioned the hope for a bright future, you decided that you must go there. It turns out that it is the home of your mother. She embraces you, wishes you luck, and gives you a small metal object on a chain.[/p]
        [p]“Perhaps this will help you some time.”[/p]
        [p]Just as you are about to go for your final briefing, a young member of the flight crew rushes up and says, “Let me go with you. You will need my help.” You don't know him well, but you have always found him warm and helpful. His name is Mermah, and his broad smile makes you feel happy about the adventures that lie ahead. Of course he can come.[/p]
        [p]The head of research warns you about Sun-Thee, a giant star twelve times the size of Earth's sun. Sun-Thee is in your path, and its enormous gravitational pull could be dangerous. He also cautions you about the black holes and supernovas. He tells you that if you want to delay your departure and go through the Space Academy, it may make your chances of success much better.[/p]

        [p]Return to the mother ship should be easy. You hit the navigation button and push the reverse command switch. But, just at that moment, the lighting in the pod turns to the flashing gre/yellow warning color, and all systems stop. Swirling gas and dust particles bathe the pod. You frantically hit re-start buttons but nothing happens.[/p]
        [p]As suddenly as the gas came, it leaves. The warning lights go off, the control panel blinks with energy, and the navigation control systems say GO. The automatic S.O.S. signal turns off, and you sit exhausted in front of the controls.[/p]

        [p]Heavy meteor showers interfere with your complex navigation system. The interference is so intense that all communications systems go out. You hurtle through space looking out through the portholes, amazed at the sights about you. But, your spacepod begins to tumble and the world spins in a maze of colors and shapes.[/p]
        [p]Your speed is so great that you should get through the shower soon, perhaps even soon enough to correct the navigational problems. On the other hand, maybe it is dangerous to assume that you can rely on chance to get you out of this fix. Wouldn't it be better and safer to radio for help? The laser radio will probably get through.[/p]

        [p]Hesitating, you ask what other types of instruction will be given to you. So far you have learned flight procedures, navigation, languages, weapons, and planning. It is a good idea to get as much information as possible, but you ask the head of research how you will know when you have learned enough.[/p]
        [p]“Knowledge is within all of us. You have but to realize it. Spend some time now. Then go.”[/p]
        [p]“All right, I'll do as you suggest. But how long will it take?”[/p]
        [p]“You may either go to the Space Academy courses on board, or you may study with me and explore the knowledge within you.” He does not smile, but he folds his arms to await your decision.[/p]

        [p]You want to be on your way. Even though it might be a rash decision, you and your new companion Mermah climb aboard the spacepod. You enter the proper numbers on the flight panel and you launch into space.[/p]
        [p]“Mermah, check the stabilizers. We seem to be spinning a bit.”[/p]
        [p]“OK. Will do.”[/p]
        [p]Just then you realize from the computer screen that your flight path is close to a black hole. The danger is that once near the gravitational field of the black hole, you will never escape. Mermah helps you check the data input to the navigation system. To your dismay, you realize that instead of punching in the figures 4800, you actually put in 4008, and your path is now locked into the black hole.[/p]
        [p]Mermah stares at you in horror as the pod continues to move toward the massive black hole. People who have been trapped by black holes have never returned.[/p]

        [p]An S.O.S. sent in space is a risky thing. There is no telling who is out there. You wait with hope and a good measure of fear. Then you see it. First a speck on the screen moving in a sideways fashion. Then it jumps into focus. It resembles an amoeba, but it has lights, portholes, and markings of an unknown sort. Abruptly, the spacecraft – or whatever it is – halts close to you.[/p]
        [p]In space, alien beings are not uncommon. You are alien to the beings in this craft jiggling outside your spacepod. But, what should you assume? Are they hostile, or are they life forms knowing neither hostility nor friendship?[/p]
        [p]There isn't much time. You must decide whether to fight and hope you can drive them off, or whether you should just go quietly and peacefully with them. Here they come. It is hard to tell whether it is one or many. They seem to be all mixed together.[/p]

        [p]Your energy indicator has faded from full energy red light to one-quarter level blue-green light. Computer analysis warns you that all life support systems will stop in three hours, sixteen minutes. But, there has been no response to your S.O.S. Through your radar scan you realize that even if help does come, it will probably not reach you before all life support systems fail. You desperately wish that there were someone in the pod to share this with, but you are alone.[/p]
        [p]You have decided to use what remaining energy there is to follow a light/island message beaming from a black hole. Black holes in space are there because the mass of the star is so great that nothing can escape its gravity field – no light, no heat, no radio waves. Yet, mysteriously a light/island – a phenomenon talked about and recorded by a rare group of intergalactic pilots – is clearly indicated coming from the region of a black hole.[/p]
        [p]You must go. At least, you feel that the choice is either go toward the black hole and the light/island or drift in helplessness waiting for a chance rescue ship.[/p]

        [p]Why wait? You just feel that you will make it through. You push the advance button, strap your seatbelts and shoulder harnesses even tighter, and push on. The bouncing and rocking is severe.[/p]
        [p]There is a popping sound. The spacepod is flung out of the meteor shower and into a transit zone.[/p]
        [p]The transit zone is a space highway designed for commercial use by transports. An amazing variety of spaceships are following different laser beam highways.[/p]
        [p]A transit zone patrol craft hovers near you and signals you to follow it. Stopping at a patrol station, you are informed that there is a space caravan that might stop at Phonon. Perhaps you could join it. It is uncertain just when it will reach Phonon though, if ever. The alternative is a band of space entertainers, an interesting group who travel wherever they wish. You could join them. They too might stop at Phonon, but you never know.[/p]

        [p]Trusting feelings works sometimes, but this situation is too dangerous. It's probably going to be embarrassing to ask for help so soon after starting out. You notice the palms of your hands and see the drops of sweat on them and their unusual whiteness. No question about it, you are scared – with good reason. Who wouldn't be?[/p]
        [p]“Spacepod, trans-galactic mission to planet Phonon, interrupted by meteor shower. System now three quarters inoperative. Repeat, Coordinate Z2380, F9212, X2922. Time reference Outer Zone 2L. Request immediate aid. Repeat, request immediate aid.”[/p]
        [p]Your voice feels small and hollow as it echoes in the pilot's compartment of the pod. You are so alone.[/p]

        [p]School can be boring, but then it might be just the thing for the flight. This space research vessel is so huge and so advanced that you didn't actually realize that there was a division of the Space Academy aboard. During your interview with the head of the Academy, he says, “Well, you choose. Either join Command School and become a captain of a ship, or go ahead and concentrate on research. We have done a personality, intelligence and health inventory on you, and you have scored very high. We believe you can make it to the top in either category. Well, what do you think?”[/p]

        [p]The name of the head of research is Pherantz. He tells you that there is an infinity of knowledge stored within all living things from countless past experiences. It sounds crazy, but then you just can't tell. You wonder if you really can call on experiences from past lives. Are there flashes of memory locked in your cells? Are the dreams you have of places you have never been, things you have never done, people you do not know, actually experiences from a past life bubbling up within you looking for a way out? Maybe dreams are a real thing. You sense a feeling of calm in the philosopher.[/p]
        [p]“Remember my friend, all travel in space accomplishes little. We end where we begin. Parallel lines cross! Time is not real. Try to make the past the present.”[/p]

    <next id="17"></next>
  </p>
  <p id="17">
    <text>
        [p]You feel uncomfortable with these heavy thoughts, especially when he talks about parallel lines crossing in space. What does infinity mean, anyway?[/p]
        [p]“We can experiment with the past.” It is the philosopher talking again. “The past is not lost. It is just changed into a different form.”[/p]
        [p]You spend days calling on past experiences. It is like a big dream machine.[/p]
        [p]“You are doing well. Would you like to give it a try?”[/p]
        [p]“What do you mean?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“You can either travel now into past time – 125 million Earth years ago, the age of dinosaurs, and wander around there – or you can just give it a chance and wander into an unknown past.”[/p]

        [p]“What do you think will happen to us, Mermah?”[/p]
        [p]“One never knows,” he replies.[/p]
        [p]With a shudder, the pod is suddenly grasped by the gravitational field, and you find yourself hurtling into a tunnel-like void. A black hole might seem black to the observer from outside because no light can possibly escape its gravitational field, but all the light and the energy is contained within this space. The tunnel is brilliantly lit but, strangely, the intense light does not hurt your eyes.[/p]
        [p]Then you are in a giant room. No, it is not a room, it is actually the interior of the black hole. It is a gigantic prism, thousands of miles across. It is a world unto itself. You are no longer frightened, and you and Mermah leave your spacepod to begin a life in a new world.[/p]
        [p]The new world is peaceful, and the people are friendly and eager to welcome you and Mermah. No one is in a hurry, and work is pleasant. There is food and housing for all. It's a good world.[/p]

        [p]You don't know what these creatures are, and you realize your weapons might not work. It seems reasonable to meet them in an open and unarmed manner. They – or it – suddenly appear inside your own craft. You have heard of pure energy passing through solid matter and then reforming into its original shape. They call it dematerialization. But this catches you by surprise.[/p]
        [p]Part of the ship's equipment is a language/thought translation device designed to make contact between different life forms as easy as possible. This alien is certainly as different from you as anyone could possibly be. There seem to be hundreds of strange creatures around you one moment, then only one. The button on the device is close at hand, and you punch it immediately, announcing, “Welcome to my spacepod. I am on a mission to my own planet. I am peaceful.”[/p]
        [p]The aliens do not respond. They make no noise, and suddenly they melt together into a large jumbled, jelly-like mass that surrounds you. You are caught in what feels like a slimy ooze. You try to kick free, but it is no use.[/p]
        [p]A sound emerges from the ooze. It is a combination of electronic beeps and lifelike bird calls. It does not reassure you. Then you feel a lightness that you have never before experienced, and in seconds you have been dematerialized and transported to the jiggling, free-form spacecraft that carries your captors.[/p]
        [p]Testing the substance their craft is made out of, you believe you could break through and escape. Their craft is wrapped around yours like Silly Putty on a tennis ball. All you need to do is figure out where your entrance hatch is, break through and get to the weapons you had stored on board. It is a slim chance, but a real one.[/p]

They invade your craft, where they seem to melt over the control board. The communications and navigation systems do not seem to be working. There is no other choice. You must fight for your life.[/p]
        [p]You reach for the emergency energy switch. Just as you do that, the creatures surrounding you melt together into a large jiggling form. With great difficulty you escape the sticky mass that holds you. A laser pistol is in your hand. You press the release button and aim at the center of the jiggling mass. You watch it shrivel, turn bright colors, smoulder, shudder, and then regenerate. You keep firing.[/p]
        [p]Sounds never before heard by humans fill the air. It is not music, and yet it has tone and a certain beauty to it. The more you fire the louder it gets. Unnoticed by you, the laser beams are hitting the instrument console, destroying major portions of it. You keep on firing. The mass shrivels, and vanishes. Silence. You have won.[/p]
        [p]But what a bitter victory. You now realize that the spacepod is destroyed. You float in space hoping for some chance rescue.[/p]

First, all the dials on the command console reverse and spin back to zero readings. Then your hair stands straight up as rigid as a wire brush. All light from your systems flows away in a stream and heads toward the black hole. You feel all your blood rush to your hands and feet, and a frightening dizziness overcomes you.[/p]
        [p]From one of the portholes, you see a pulsating, velvet-like mass larger than the sky – or so it seems.[/p]
        [p]A sharp, piercing cry wails, “Go back, before it is too late. Go back now.”[/p]
        [p]You have absolutely no idea where this warning is coming from. Perhaps you can still turn back. Maybe it is not too late. Maybe there is enough energy reserve to escape the intense gravitational field of the black hole.[/p]

She is a beautiful Noomanian – beautiful at least by Noomanian standards. You communicate with her by using the language translation device.[/p]
        [p]Her name is Eus, and she explains to you that her group gathers exotic delicacies and objects. They never know where they are going. They go one stop at a time. For example, Eus informs you that they are on their way to the planet Earth with a consignment of black hole dust. The earthlings believe it is a magic potion giving them eternal youth. Eus laughs at that, saying, “Foolish earthlings, they always want what they can't have and what is really unimportant anyway.” Then she says, “Come along, we can't wait.”[/p]
        [p]So off you go. When you arrive on Earth, you are fascinated by this strange civilization with its tall ugly buildings, its people who look like you but are rushing, rushing, rushing and buying, buying, buying. It amuses you. What a peculiar place![/p]

        [p]Being a pilot-in-command of a space mission sounds impressive to you. You enroll in the Academy. Mermah decides to join you. All thought of going to either Phonon or Zermacroyd leaves you, as the courses of study interest you more and more each day. The time passes and you achieve advanced standing in the Academy. Your parents are proud of you, and upon graduation, you and Mermah are assigned to a new and radically different spacecraft designed to carry out deep probes into the remote and unexplored regions of intergalactic space.[/p]
        [p]Bidding all friends and family a farewell, you and Mermah enter the new craft for a twelve-year probe into uncharted regions.[/p]

        [p]What is research about? You have heard nothing but “research, research, and more research” from everyone on the space station. It seems to you that research is just another name for messing around with whatever interests you. You'll give it a try.[/p]
        [p]“The subject of our research happens to be the cause of the violent trouble – specifically revolts – that occurs on all planets. Revolutions and wars have caused pain, but they have caused good things, too. What we want to find out is if the benefits can be gotten without the pain and horror of the uprisings.” It is the research coordinator talking to a select group of six people. You have been chosen because of your aptitude for finding solutions to difficult puzzles.[/p]
        [p]This is beginning to really interest you. Your intention to journey to Phonon and Zermacroyd seems to fade into some distant place in your mind. Mermah has chosen to remain with you. He is a good companion.[/p]
        [p]After intensive work, the research team decides to split into two teams. Team A will head to the planet Cynthia to view a current revolt. Team B will join a mission exploring a revolt on Mars that happened 62 million years ago – a time transporter device will be used for that.[/p]

        [p]You remember studying the mind tapes of the evolution of living things on twelve planets. Earth was one of the planets, and the time period of the dinosaurs always fascinated you. The Cretaceous period when Tyrannosaurus Rex lived was a difficult but fascinating time. Suddenly, you are there, in a world without any human creatures. You are shocked to see that you have become a Velociraptor, very small in comparison to the Tyrannosaurus Rex and a prey to his voracious appetite.[/p]
        [p]Hiding behind some lush vegetation, you are frightened and hungry, but you don't dare move. Any movement in this world could end in a sudden and violent death. You hear a scuttling sound, and a small Protoceratops rushes by, saying, “It's all clear, now. Tyrannosaurus and that awful Tarbosaurus have gone off to quarrel by themselves. Maybe it will give us a break.”[/p]
        [p]You cautiously peer out from the bushes and plants, then step gingerly away from your protective shelter. You gain a vantage point to watch Tyrannosaurus and Tarbosaurus locked in a bloody fight. You are horrified as their sharp teeth and powerful arms and legs tear at each other. There is a terrible howling roar of pain, then a crunching sound as Rex succeeds in biting off the head of his enemy.[/p]

        [p]A chance to go to the unknown is probably really risky, but there is that desire in most people to take big risks. You race back in time toward the edge of eternity, the beginning of the entire universe. You achieve an elastic weightlessness, and a sense of complete peace and calm. There is no sound, no light. But no darkness either. You race back to the very beginning, to the pulsating, exciting start. You return to the big bang that started the whole thing. You are and you have been a part of everything, always. The beginning is the end.[/p]

They reform again into a solid mass, and then they question you in a high, metallic voice. It reminds you of early tapes that had been found in the space museum of an old civilization on an unnamed planet. There is the same tinkly sound. This is what they said:[/p]
        [p]“We are half object, half life form. The line between living and non-living things is not clear where we come from, but then what is ever really clear?[/p]
        [p]”We need a creature like you to aid us in our trans-galactic search for a new planet. Our planet is in grave danger of atomic reorganization. We fear it will soon disintegrate. Our inability to remain in one way of being – object or life form – makes it necessary to join with a totally living creature. You have a choice. Help us in our search, or be cast adrift in this galaxy.[/p]

        [p]Then it works. The mind-scan blinks, “Read-Out,” ready for communication.[/p]
        [p]“Main energy source located in lower trident, sequential grid, negative factor 3, eliminate E34, B13, optimize radical paramater input and proceed with viable alternatives.” It sounds like crazy Earth talk to you, but you follow it, and you realize that you can render these creatures helpless, and even destroy them if you wish.[/p]
        [p]“Listen to me. You have one chance. Either disengage from this assault or I will deactivate you. This is just a sample.” You momentarily release the sequence programmed for deactivation. Within a microsecond the creatures begin to tremble. But they are tough.[/p]

You leave the spacepod and are greeted by a group of six creatures who before your eyes change age and features, transforming from babies to old people. It is more than you can understand. It is frightening. It is watching the past become the present and the present turn into the future. It is a kaleidoscope of life, endlessly repeating the cycle of birth and death.[/p]
        [p]You realize that it is beginning to happen to you, as well. You look down at your hands and they are small and pink – baby's hands. Before your very eyes they grow and change color and texture. A rush of time and experience engulfs you. It is not unpleasant, but you have no control over it. Then, you are horrified to see the wrinkled skin and dark liver spots of old age appear on your hands.[/p]

It is described as one of the more hostile worlds, and only real adventurers risk spending much time there. Then there are those earth people who, in spite of all the violence, designed great societies benefiting all earthlings. It certainly is a mixed picture. Maybe you should stay.[/p]
        [p]So, you transfer to earth life systems by programming your bio-computer to accommodate for earth atmosphere, language and food intake.[/p]

        [p]RS-3, UGB enters the atmosphere of Axle. The scientists anxiously scan the operating equipment that monitors atmospheric conditions, existence of microorganisms, and energy relations. All seems natural. The ship hovers above the major city, Ntial. A landing party is formed. You are not asked to join, but you are fascinated by what is happening below. The TV monitors reveal a city in silence. Few living beings are seen, and those that are found look weak and listless.[/p]
        [p]The landing party radios back that a strange fever has gripped Axle, affecting virtually all its inhabitants. They are too weak to help themselves.[/p]
        [p]The research landing party now reports that three of its members are exhibiting symptoms similar to the Axlians'. They are retreating to formulate new plans. They also report that obviously certain beings from other planets are immune while others are not. They feel that only the immune should work on the planet to help fight the disease.[/p]

After a long, honest talk with the ship's commander, he says, “I understand your reluctance to join us, and I commend you for your courage in admitting your fear and concern. We will do what we can to help you on your way. Good luck. Gleeb Fogo (the Universal Salute of Friendship).”[/p]

No towns or cities are visible as the craft flies over the empty landscape. Where are the people? Where is the revolt?[/p]
        [p]You land with the advance party, and find the atmosphere almost acceptable to your bio-system. You need only the smallest assistance from the life support pack. Mermah accompanies you.[/p]
        [p]“Did you see that?”[/p]

        [p]“Only a shadow. A shadow moving quickly, as though it were following us.”[/p]
        [p]Then a short blast of a hornlike device stops you in your tracks. You are surrounded by flickering shapes, living creatures who blend and twist like shadows. You can't tell what they are.[/p]
        [p]“Peace or war? You! Are you the leader or just the follower?” It's the shadow people speaking.[/p]
        [p]“Peace, of course. In our world we don't believe in war.”[/p]

        [p]You don't know whether to believe them or not, but there is no choice. You must go with them. They take you to headquarters. There they explain how the forces of light have attempted to wipe out the shadow people by creating a world with no shadows where light comes from all directions. The light people will not allow the mix of light and dark that colors life.[/p]

You see stars born and see them die, you see planets spin off into space, comets come and go, supernovas exploding, and all the time, you are not even there. You are but pure energy counting down in time until you stop at Mars, a planet of a small sun in the Milky Way galaxy – an almost unheard of planet in an insignificant galaxy.[/p]
        [p]When you arrive on Mars, you are invisible and can travel through space, through solid matter, and even into the thoughts of people.[/p]
        [p]What is the cause of revolt on Mars? Who knows. Greed? Famine? Envy? Jealousy? Maybe just an instinctive need to battle, a basic drive to test and fight for the sheer sense of fighting. It's too complex. Everyone has a different answer. They all point to the other guy. All you know is that creatures get killed, cities get destroyed. What a way to live. That's why there is a new way – if only it will work. You are part of the new way, a way of sharing.[/p]

It is the dawn of mankind, and the earliest human types are just developing their life patterns. They live as hunters and gatherers.

Then a part of the mass seems to separate, draws itself into a close approximation of a human form and announces in a high-pitched singsong voice, “We recognize that you may have the power to destroy us. But we have decided to trust you. If you were hostile, you would have destroyed us without thinking twice. We believe that you are good.” There is a burble of assent from the jumbled mass. The speech continues.[/p]
        [p]“We are on a mission from our home planet. We desperately need a special plasma that provides the energy for our thought generators. Without this plasma, which is no longer available on our planet, we are finished. We will become just big, messy blobs without direction. We need the guidance of thought.

What have you got to lose? You might as well go along. It could be interesting.[/p]

The entire area is bathed in beautiful colors that radiate warmth and positive force. The light seems to unify everything around you.

        [p]A transport beam picks you up, and suddenly you are inside the giant spacecraft. Oddly, no one or nothing with life seems to be aboard this craft. You are placed by means of mechanical arms in a small room. Food, books, music, tapes are on a table. The humming stops. Then a voice says. “We have been searching for you, and we welcome you to life aboard Craabox. We are a small world of ourselves. We need your type to complete our society. Enjoy yourself. No harm will come to you.”[/p]
        [p]The humming sounds begin again, and you doze off into deep sleep.[/p]
        [p]When you awake, you are told by the voice to go either to room 99 or 100. You ask why, but the voice only says choose. Choose what? It's a flip of the coin – there is no real choice. Go ahead, flip.[/p]

The maximum leader has been ordered to return for very high, very important, very complicated, unknown negotiations back at their base. Maybe a minimum leader is a better thing. At any rate, down you go, and make a landing in a sandy area covered with small bushes.[/p]

        [p]Only one clue exists. It is a radio transmission recorded on your research vessel when Axle made its call for help. The message is unclear, but it gives space coordinates that include the neighboring planet of Fleedes. You travel there, and what you find is appalling. The planet is almost uninhabited. There is the wreckage of cities and towns. It looks like a massive war has taken place, but there is no evidence of a victorious force in command. There is evidence of the fever here too.[/p]

The Universe Governing Body has always tried to promote sharing, but it seldom works. Here is the chance. Now is the time. You join sides to promote the sharing of energy throughout the galaxies.[/p]

        [p]The Universe Governing Body has serious news. There is a major energy drain throughout all galaxies. No one has been able to identify the cause of the loss of energy, but there is a shutting down of systems in all quadrants; transportation, communication, life support, all systems. It is as though a giant battery were drained and growing weaker by the minute. You are all on your own now.[/p]

        [p]Well, well, so your flip landed you here. What a surprise, your luck has just reversed time and space. You are back at the start. You have been given another chance. Try again! And good luck![/p]

        [p]Not bad. You flipped and you won. Room 100 is the Chamber of Leadership. You will be made commander of this strange artificial world. You will learn all that is to be learned, you will see all there is. to see, you will then guide this roving mini-world through the galaxies investigating, learning more, collecting specimens of other life forms.[/p]

        [p]Wherever you go, people or creatures seem to be fighting. They want more land, or water, or power, or maybe just excitement.[/p]
        [p]You become a natural leader, because the forces you join are leaderless and tired of conflict. After listening to all the complaints, you offer to negotiate for peace. But at your first negotiation with the hostile forces, you are captured and the war goes on.[/p]

        [p]“OK, student, tell me about yourself. What is a student, anyway?”[/p]
        [p]The student is relaxed. At least he is out of school, and he isn't really afraid of you.[/p]
        [p]“Well, I don't know. Being a student is like being a prisoner. Everyone is always telling you what to do, where to go, what not to say, and you always get yelled at. It's a bummer.”[/p]
        [p]You are shocked by what he says. After all, you enjoyed learning things. You ask, “Isn't there anything good about being a student?”[/p]
        [p]“Well, vacations, and you don't usually have to do much. You can get by.”[/p]
        [p]“Are you dangerous?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]“No, they only think so. We aren't.”[/p]
        [p]Suddenly the student leaps up and grabs you by the arms. You are tied up. Now you are his prisoner. He says, “See how you like it. I'm calling the authorities.”[/p]
        [p]He makes the call, and soon you are carried away by uniformed men. You will be the object of study for years to come. Your freedom is gone forever.[/p]

        [p]“A politician, what is that?” you ask.[/p]
        [p]The person hems and haws. Then the person begins to speak. “A politician serves the people and helps them make the right choices. We are very, very, very IMPORTANT! Why, without us there would be no problems – I, I mean, without us, problems would not appear to be so large. I – I – mean, well, I mean we create more problems than we solve and that is how we stay in office because someone has to solve them.”[/p]
        [p]The politician begins to smile. He acts very friendly and says, “Hey, wait a minute. You're from another planet. We could become famous, you and I. Think of it. The whole world will want to see you and hear all about it. I'll be your manager. We'll make a bundle!”[/p]
        [p]You get out of there as fast as you can. You want no part of this freak show. But as you try to leave, he blocks the way, and you are caught. You remain on Earth as a curiosity from outer space.[/p]

        [p]You remember a secret weapon given to you before you left the research ship. It is an intergalactic slow-time weapon. When you operate it, all motion and action freezes in time. No one is hurt, and the simple release of the energy field restores motion. You activate the device and disarm all the people on both sides. Then you program a future time leap to a place in time when peace is possible. It is weird wandering around with all these people looking like statues, but then suddenly they are alive again and wonder at the new world. They actually have forgotten the past and they can start again.[/p]

        [p class="end"]The EndYou and your group of pirates are surrounded by Universe Governing Body pursuit ships. You are deported to a distant and dim galaxy and guarded by Universe troops. Your pirating days are over.[/p]

        [p]What fun to be a pirate! It is a good life, and the treasure box on the spacecraft overflows with Universe Governing Body money.[/p]
        [p]But then, one day, you intercept a radio broadcast. The Universe Governing Body announces that all currency and money are worthless and no longer needed or used. A new system for sharing food, clothing, and shelter that doesn't use money has been set in motion. As pirates you are finished. There is nothing left to steal.[/p]

        [p]The future of life on Earth is almost too much to think about. Anything could happen. You give it a try. Selecting the future in fifty years, you find yourself with a group of about sixty people, all young, all healthy looking. They tell you that you are in a select group that is about to leave on a mission to find another planet to live on. Earth has become overcrowded, badly polluted, worn out, and dangerous. Wars, famine, and disease have made it unlivable. You don't really believe them, but they seem serious.[/p]
        [p]Then a large spacecraft arrives. You all get aboard and accelerate into space. It's all too familiar to you. This is the way you started, on a spaceship going between galaxies. It's starting all over again. Will the adventures never end?[/p]

        [p]A cleaning operation is exactly that. Once you have found no evidence of living creatures about, several small transporter ships are equipped with laser-spreading devices that will cleanse the area of any and all bacterial life. It is a drastic step, because the laser will eradicate all life forms. But, the operation has been ordered. You have no choice but to carry it out.[/p]

        [p]The past is often rich with knowledge and solutions that the present has chosen to forget. You scan the data banks of the ship's computers for similar incidents. There have been similar plagues, and you discover a supposed cure. It was used on a remote planet, which was mostly desert, but with rivers and high mountains cutting into the wastelands of sand. It requires the sacrifice of ten percent of the population. Supposedly, the sacrifice will appease angry gods. Of course the Axlians won't go along with it. Who would?[/p]
        [p]There is no cure. The fever will have to run its course.[/p]

They welcome you with great happiness. Oddly, the cure for the fever is simple – complete rest in the light of the three moons of Axle for three weeks with no solid food and only moderate liquids. Simple, ancient, and effective. You are cured, and the future lies before you.[/p]
